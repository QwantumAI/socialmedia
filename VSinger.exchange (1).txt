VSinger and Metaverse 
Virtual singers can have an impact on the metaverse, which is a term used to describe a virtual universe where users can interact with each other and with digital objects and environments. Virtual singers can be used in the metaverse to create immersive experiences for users and to provide new forms of entertainment.
One way virtual singers can be used in the metaverse is as performers in virtual concerts or music festivals. Users can interact with virtual singers in real-time, creating a more immersive and engaging experience. Virtual singers can also be used in the metaverse to create interactive music videos, where users can interact with the virtual singer and the environment.
Additionally, virtual singers can be used in the metaverse as avatars to create virtual worlds, where users can interact with each other and with digital objects and environments in a more immersive way. This can be especially useful for people who want to escape the real world and explore new and exciting virtual worlds.
Overall, virtual singers are powerful tool and they becoming increasingly popular in the metaverse, with popular virtual singers such as Polar, ABBA, and Axel Merengue gaining millions of real-world followers. VSinger is a unique form of entertainment that is allowing virtual performers to gain real-world recognition and fame.


Virtual idol
virtual idol is a VSinger who performs music and entertainment through the Metaverse. Virtual Idol is a term coined in China that refers to a virtual singer who performs in the virtual world, or Metaverse. These virtual idol singers are often created using 3D modeling and animation techniques, and they often interact with their fans using a variety of mediums such as live streaming, video, and audio. VSinger is becoming increasingly popular in the music industry, and they are gaining more recognition and popularity with each passing day.


VSinger vs VTuber


VSinger and VTuber are both computer-generated characters that entertain viewers through performances, streaming games, and real-time interactions. The key difference between the two is that VSinger are typically limited by the rules of idol culture and industry standards of cuteness and approachability, while VTuber don't have many restrictions and are allowed to express themselves more freely.


VSinger via NFT
Virtual singers can be used in conjunction with NFTs is by creating virtual singer NFTs. These could be digital collectibles that represent virtual singers, which can be bought, sold, and traded on blockchain marketplaces creating new revenue streams and opportunities for virtual singers.
These NFTs can include an array of information, such as the virtual singer's image, sound, and background information.
Another way virtual singers can be used in conjunction with NFTs is by creating NFTs that represent ownership of virtual singer's performances. These NFTs could be used to represent ownership of a virtual singer's performance in a virtual concert or music festival. This would allow fans to own a unique piece of the virtual singer's performance and could create scarcity and value for those NFTs.
Additionally, NFTs could be used to represent ownership of virtual singers' music video, giving fans the ability to own a unique, one-of-a-kind version of the video.










VSinger marketplace
There is not yet any marketplace specifically designed for socializing with VSinger. Most marketplaces that sell VSingers NFTs are part of larger NFT marketplaces, which do not offer the right environment to present the underlying assets and income streams, including merchandise and copyright licensing.


Current market overview 
The current market for non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is facing several challenges. One of these challenges is the need for a marketplace to trade NFTs, similar to eBay. However, these marketplaces can be vulnerable to fraud and low volume, which can hinder liquidity. In addition, there is the risk of scammers manipulating the market by using multiple wallets and transactions to artificially inflate the price of their own NFTs and then selling them to unsuspecting buyers at a premium. This can erode community trust and decrease speculation and buying.
Even if a marketplace is free of fraud and scams, it is still likely to face other issues. P2P galleries, like OpenSea, may become overcrowded and resemble stock photo sites or app stores with a vast number of offerings. This could make it difficult for creators and investors to sell their VSingers or VSinger collections, as they may struggle to gain the visibility and promotion needed to succeed. The market may become dominated by a small number of influencers or celebrities who are able to generate the necessary hype to sell their VSingers.


Needs for a better VSinger marketplace 
There is a need for a better VSinger marketplace that addresses several issues currently facing the market. One of these issues is the need to generate sustainable liquidity for sellers, regardless of market conditions. This means that sellers should be able to easily buy and sell their VSingers even when the market is experiencing downturns or volatility.
Another need is to create a marketplace that provides equal opportunity for all sellers, regardless of their level of promotion or recognition. This includes providing opportunities for new and unknown creators to sell their VSingers and generate income streams from their intellectual property.
The marketplace should also work to eliminate scams and pump and dump schemes, which can manipulate the market and harm honest sellers and buyers. By providing a safe and transparent marketplace, it will be possible to increase confidence and trust in the market, which can in turn drive increased liquidity and buying pressure.
VSinger.exchange is an NFT decentralized exchange that aims to address all the challenges facing the market, including the need for sustainable liquidity, buy pressure, and the removal of pump and dump schemes. It does this by using quantum finance models to create the world's first NFT based on 100% liquidity protection through techniques such as Reverse Market Making, Decentralized Venture Capital, and IP income stream generation.
Unlike other NFT marketplaces, which are often centralized and built as peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms, VSinger.exchange is the world's first decentralized NFT exchange to support both peer-to-contract (P2C) and contract-to-contract (C2C) transactions. This decentralized approach is meant to provide additional security and transparency for buyers and sellers.


Quantum Finance
Quantum finance is a new field that uses theories and methods developed by quantum physicists and economists to solve problems in finance. Unlike traditional binary methods, which are based on two positions (0 and 1, false and true) and often result in a zero-sum game with high risk and limited possibilities, quantum finance introduces multiple positions that can significantly reduce risk and create liquidity even for non-liquid assets.
The VSinger.exchange applies quantum finance principles in a way that allows investors to simultaneously hold two contradictory positions: one as a buyer and owner of a VSinger, and another as a non-buyer and non-owner. This allows investors to potentially profit from their investments and then decide whether to finalize the transaction as a buyer or walk away, depending on how the market develops or the VSinger's success becomes.


Although quantum finance is a relatively new field, the team behind VSinger.exchange believes that it has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about finance and investment. They are proud to be among the first to bring this concept to the blockchain.


Reverse Market Making 
Reverse Market Making (RMM) is a liquidity solution that was designed to boost the non-fungible token (NFT) industry in a similar way to how Automated Market Making (AMM) has helped the cryptocurrency market and created the DeFi bull run. AMM has been used by decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap and Pancakeswap to provide liquidity to brand new projects from the start, without the barriers of traditional centralized exchanges (CEXs). It has also paved the way for the development of new lending, options, and derivative protocols, which are now an important part of the decentralized financial ecosystem.
RMM works by creating instant liquidity for any VSinger through a smart contract, without the need for a counterparty buyer. It allows buyers to reverse their trade back to the smart contract like it was a refund or cancellation order, while the seller acts as the market maker and benefits from the trade-off regardless of the outcome. This liquidity solution provides protection for buyers during the period of liquidity protection.


100% Liquidity protection
VSinger and VSinger collections can be difficult to trade due to scalability issues, limited liquidity, and higher risks for investors. These risks are exacerbated by bad actors who promote assets through manipulating their value and demand using fake wallets, and the lack of a guarantee of liquidity for sellers.
To address these issues, VSinger.exchange designed 100% liquidity protection solution for buyers. This means that sellers can act as market makers by offering buyers protection for a certain period of time, during which buyers have the option to return the VSinger to the smart contract and receive back the exact protected value in the same tokens that they invested with. This protection is available regardless of market conditions, helping to reduce risk for buyers and make it easier for them to trade VSingers.[1]


example 
* Bob seeks to sell his VSinger for $1,000 while earning a reward as a market maker
* Bob uses Reverse Market Making (RMM) to provide future buyers with liquidity protection for 90 days in exchange for a 5% slippage fee in case of cancellation
* This ensures Bob earns a 5% profit over 90 days, equating to a 20% annual percentage yield (APY)
* Lisa decides to purchase Bob's VSinger for $1,000 and transfers her funds to a Liquidity Protection smart contract
* If Lisa finalizes the transaction, she will only have to pay the base price of $1,000 to Bob
* If market conditions deteriorate or Lisa is unable to resell the VSinger , she has the option to reverse the transaction and receive a full refund of her funds, minus any applicable fees and slippage.


 




Earning from making the market
Sellers who act as market makers utlzing the RMM have the opportunity to earn rewards in two ways: through slippage and by leveraging staking.
Slippage reward
Slippage reward is a form of compensation that sellers can request in exchange for offering a liquidity protection period. The amount of slippage is disclosed to and agreed upon by the buyer before the transaction takes place, and it is fixed rather than being unpredictable like it is on some decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
Leveraging staking 
Alternatively or in addition to slippage, sellers can offer buyers low or even zero slippage in exchange for the opportunity to leverage the buyer's funds on a third-party decentralized protocol to generate passive income through annual percentage yield (APY). This can reduce the cost for the buyer to zero and provide the seller with enough reward to justify acting as a market maker. In both cases, the initial principal from the purchase is secured in a smart contract vault and is not sent to the seller until the sale is finalized.[2]
Benefits for sellers and buyers utilizing RMM
There are several benefits for both sellers and buyers to utlize the RMM solution. Sellers can potentially increase their conversion rate and provide equal opportunities to new and unknown VSinger creators by offering liquidity protection. They can also earn rewards as market makers regardless of the sale outcome, and if they choose to leverage staking, they can keep any APY staking rewards earned. This earning while selling concept is similar to a traditional lease-to-own concept in the real estate industry.
Buyers, on the other hand, can hedge their investments and explore higher-risk and potentially lucrative new opportunities with the knowing that they can always reverse the trade back to the smart contract like it was a cancellation or refund without any tax triggers if they are unable to sell the VSinger to a new buyer. If a buyer agrees to a slippage reward, they will only pay it if they cancel the transaction and receive a full refund. If the seller is leveraging staking, the buyer does not have to pay anything in exchange for the liquidity protection; instead, the seller is paid by a third-party decentralized staking protocol such as Curve, Venus, or Yearn Finance.






Liquidity protection process
The liquidity protection process is a way for sellers to offer buyers protection against potential losses that may occur when buying and selling assets. The process involves the use of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) to represent the protection offered to buyers.
Step 1 - Offering
sellers offer buyers 100% liquidity protection for a specified number of days, and select a reward for the protection based on slippage or leverage staking.


Step 2 - Selection
buyers can select an VSinger that provides the desired liquidity protection and reward.


Step 3 - Sale and protection period
the slippage reward is sent to the seller immediately and is non-refundable. The funds covered by the liquidity protection are locked in a smart contract and, if the seller has offered liquidity protection with leverage staking, are also transferred to decentralized protocols like yearn.finance or Venus to generate passive annual percentage yield (APY) as a reward for the seller.


Step 4 - Buyer revokes liquidity protection
buyers have the option to revoke the liquidity protection by returning the VSinger to the seller's liquidity protection smart contract. This triggers a full refund of the protected funds in the original token used by the buyer. If the transaction included leverage staking, the seller will receive the APY market making rewards and the buyer will receive their protected funds from the decentralized protocols in the form of a wrapped token (such as cUSDC or vUSDC).
Alternatively, if the VSinger is not returned to the liquidity protection contract during the protection period, the seller can claim payment from the smart contract once the period expires, indicating a successful sell.
Seller use case 
-       Imagine a seller of 100 different VSingers
-       The seller offers all 100 VSingers for $10,000 each (worth $1,000,000 total)
Thos VSinger are protected by liquidity protection in exchange for leveraging staking or fix slippage
-       Once received, the $1,000,000 received by the contract, it is automatically sent to Venus and/or yearn.finance with an average 10% APY or stay in the vault in exchange for immediate fixed slippage of let’s say 10%
-       During the protection period 95% of the VSingers are canceled and 5% are sold
-       For the 5% VSingers sold, the seller receives the full payment of $50K and the buyer receives back the VSinger’s
-       The funds for the remaining 95% of the VSinger’s that were canceled are returned to the buyer and the VSingers to the seller.
-       During this period, the seller generated APY above the $1,000,000 value of the VSingers, equal to $100,000
-       The total profit for the seller is $150,000 ($50,000 for the sold VSingers + $100,000 reward) representing 300% ROI over 50K sold VSinger supply.




Unlimited liquidity protection layers
RMM designed to increase liquidity and demand for VSingers in the same way that the Bill of Exchange, a financial instrument from the 17th century, increased liquidity for money. When a buyer purchases an VSinger with liquidity protection via RMM, the protection acts as collateral for the buyer. This means that the buyer can then sell the same VSinger to another buyer with liquidity protection, potentially at a higher price, and earn a profit. This process can be repeated multiple times, with the VSinger being resold to successive buyers with liquidity protection, potentially resulting in increased trading volume and value for the VSinger . The number of times the VSinger can be resold in this way is unlimited.


Incentives for buyers to create a buy pressure 
There are several incentives for buyers to create buying pressure for VSingers via RMM (Reserve Market Making) and retain or resell them in the future, such as:
1. Buyers can register themselves as future owners under the multilevel ownership, even if they bought and sold the VSingers at a higher, same, or lower price.
2. Buyers can earn market-making rewards that are larger than the rewards they pay to their sellers.
3. Buyers can at any time fork their VSingers and create derivatives or sub-collections, and then conduct an initial offering, but  they  can only claim the profits generated from these sales once their liquidity protection period has expired, as an alternative they can also sell the NFT along with underlying locked profits from the sub-collections to the next buyer.


Example of cancellation 
* Bob purchases an VSingers from the creator for $10,000, with a 100-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 5% slippage (the creator is instantly compensated for this slippage)


* Lisa then purchases the same VSingers from Bob for $20,000, with a 90-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 10% slippage (Bob is instantly compensated for this slippage). 


* Peter then purchases the VSingers from Lisa for $40,000, with a 60-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 2% slippage (Lisa is instantly compensated for this slippage).


* After 30 days, Peter decides to cancel the purchase and gets back his $40,000 minus slippage. The VSingers is returned to Lisa, 
* If no new buyer is found, Lisa has the option to keep the VSinger or trigger her liquidity protection and return it to Bob in exchange for a full refund minus slippage and fees.
* Once Bob receives the VSinger , the system automatically relists it for resale under the same terms as before.
* If it remains unsold, Bob has the option to keep it or trigger the liquidity protection and return it to the creator in exchange for a full refund minus slippage and fees.


In this scenario, none of the buyers in the liquidity protection layers are exposed to any principal loss. At the same time, each buyer who acts as a seller is rewarded as a market-maker via slippage compensation, including the creator.






Example of completion
* Bob purchases an VSingers from the creator for $10,000, with a 100-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 5% slippage (the creator is instantly compensated for this slippage).


* Lisa then purchases the same VSingers from Bob for $20,000, with a 90-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 10% slippage (Bob is instantly compensated for this slippage). 


* Peter then purchases the VSingers from Lisa for $40,000, with a 60-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 2% slippage (Lisa is instantly compensated for this slippage).


* After 60 days have passed, the liquidity protection for Peter has expired. As a result, Peter retains the VSingers and all the sellers, including the creator, can claim their sales profits from the smart contract.




VSinger.exchange vs OpenSea
Opensea is comparable to a centralized crypto exchange that operates on a peer-to-peer model, whereas VSinger.exchange is more akin to a decentralized exchange that relies on peer-to-contract transactions.
Comparing example for seller
OpenSea peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace
* Bob represents an agency selling 100 VSingers.
* Each VSinger is priced at $10,000.
* Total value of the VSingers is $1,000,000.
* Bob lists the VSingers on OpenSea.
* Bob has a 5% conversion sale rate.
* Bob receives $50,000 from the sale of the VSingers.
* The remaining $950,000 worth of VSingers do not sell.


VSX peer-to-contract (P2C) decentrlzed exchange 
* Bob uses P2C to sell 100 VSingers.
* Each VSinger is sold at $10,000, totaling $1,000,000.
* Bob lists the VSingers with liquidity protection for 365 days.
* Bob has a 95% cancellation rate while the VSingers are under liquidity protection.
* Actual sale rate is 5%, like on OpenSea.
* Bob receives $50,000 from selling the VSingers.
* Bob receives an additional $95,000 from generating 10% slippage or APY over the unsold VSingers ($950,000).
* Bob's total reward is 290% more than on a peer-to-peer marketplace like OpenSea.




Comparing example for buyer
OpenSea - Peer-to-Peer (P2P) 
-          Lisa purchased VSinger for $10,000 
-          Lisa can’t find a buyer for her VSinger and she left with zero sum game. Meaning the
VSinger has no value.
VSX  - Peer-to-Contract  (P2C)
-          Lisa purchased VSinger for $10,000 
-          Lisa can’t find a buyer for her VSinger so she return it back to the liquidity protection smart 
contract and get a full 100% refund (minus VSinger,exxchange 2.5% transaction fee and pre agreed slippage if exist) if Lisa agreed to liquidity leverage instead of slippage reward, then lisa will get all her investment back fully (minus VSinger,exxchange 2.5% transaction fee)
Liquidity for P2P marketplaces
VSingers that have been protected via RMM can be also sold on peer-to-peer (P2P) basic marketplaces such as Opensea and SuperRare.
The liquidity protection feature remains linked to the VSinger even after it is sold, so that future buyers on other platforms can return the VSinger to the liquidity protection smart contract on VTube.exhange. This allows for the VSinger to continue being protected even if it is resold multiple times on different platforms.


14-day days cancellation law
The US 14-day cooling-off period and the Europe 14-day right of withdrawal, as consumer protection laws, can pose risks for NFT sellers in the form of cancellations and class action lawsuits. These laws give consumers the right to cancel a sale and receive a refund within a specified time frame, which could result in financial losses for NFT sellers, as they may need to refund the purchase price for NFTs that have already been sold.
In addition, NFT sellers could be exposed to class action lawsuits if they fail to comply with these laws. For example, if a large number of consumers claim that their rights under the cooling-off period or right of withdrawal were violated, they could band together and bring a class action lawsuit against the NFT seller. This could result in significant legal expenses, as well as financial damages if the NFT seller is found to have violated the law.
It is important for NFT sellers to be aware of the relevant consumer protection laws in their jurisdiction, and to ensure that they comply with these laws in their NFT sales activities. This may include incorporating the provisions of the cooling-off period and right of withdrawal into NFT sales contracts and providing consumers with clear and concise information about their rights under these laws.
The current marketplaces, such as OpenSea may be considered facilitators or intermediaries in NFT sales, rather than direct sellers of NFTs. In some cases, this could limit the marketplaces' exposure to consumer protection laws such as the cooling-off period or right of withdrawal, as the primary responsibility for complying with these laws would lie with the NFT seller.
However, depending on the jurisdiction and the specific provisions of each law, OpenSea could still be exposed to class action lawsuits if consumers claim that their rights under the cooling-off period or right of withdrawal were violated. For example, if a large number of consumers claim that the NFT sellers on OpenSea violated their rights under these laws, they could band together and bring a class action lawsuit against OpenSea.

Automated Decentralized Syndication 
VSinger.exchange's Automated Decentralized Syndication (ADS) allows any buyer or seller to pool funds together to purchase an VSinger and automatically resell it for a profit. ADS acts as the owner of the VSinger and each ADS can only be used for one VSinger. All members of the ADS have an equal share based on their investment amount, and can claim their profits or refunded principal at any time without authorization from other investors. ADS provides is a security compliant, efficient, and scalable solution for group purchasing of VSingers, avoiding the security risks and potential deadlock of tokenized tokens that can occur with other syndication models.




Multilevel ownership
The multilevel ownership contract allows sellers to continue earning passive income from the sale of their assets even after the asset has been resold multiple times. This means that the asset will continue to generate profits for its previous owners. The income from each new sale is split proportionally among all current owners in real-time. This solution is fully decentralized and works even if the asset is listed and sold on exchanges that do not support this model.

Transaction fee 
When a purchase is made on VTube.exhange, a 2.5% transaction fee is immediately applied. After the fee is applied, the seller will receive the remaining amount once the transaction is no longer under protection. If the seller charges a slippage fee, it will be calculated based on the remaining amount after the VTube.exhange transaction fee. For example, if the sale price is $100, the seller will be eligible for $97.5. If the seller charges a 10% slippage fee, they will receive $9.75 immediately, and the remaining $87.75 will be locked under the liquidity protection contract. 
The VTube.exhange fees are reimbursed in VSX tokens through the reimbursement staking smart contract, eliminating any costs for the seller.


Cancelation fee
If a buyer returns an VSingerto the liquidity protection contract, the sale fee that was originally paid by the seller becomes a cancellation fee that is paid by the buyer. For example, if the sale price is $100 and the VTube.exhange fee is 2.5%, the buyer's liquidity protection will be $97.5. If the seller charges a 10% slippage fee, the buyer will receive a refund of $87.75. 
The VTube.exhange fees are reimbursed in VSX tokens through the reimbursement staking smart contract, eliminating any costs for the buyer.

The fees generated from VTube.exhange are used as follows: 80% is used to buy VSX tokens, which increases the value of the token and decreases the total supply. 20% goes to Qwantum Finance Labs as a licensing fee for the VTube.exhange technology and to support the project.


100% fee reimbursement
VTube.exhange users have the option to receive 100% reimbursement for their gas and fees. To claim these reimbursements, users can use the reimbursement staking contract. To release the reimbursements, users must stake an equal amount of VSX tokens for one year, but they can withdraw partial amounts before the one year period is up. Any remaining balance will accumulate and can be claimed later. 


For example, if a user spends over $1000 on gas and fees over the course of a year, they can be reimbursed for these costs at any time, even if the value of the VSX tokens has increased. The reimbursement staking contract allows users to receive these reimbursements for free and reduces the sale pressure on the secondary market. The rules for the reimbursement staking contract can be changed through DAO voting.


Regular P2P sales are FREE
In addition to the innovative solutions offered by VSingers.exchange, it also enables users to conduct standard peer-to-peer transactions (without liquidity protection) that are offered by other NFT marketplaces, such as OpenSea, Uniswap, and others, at no charge and with 0% fees.
Tokenomics
Digital Royalty Token
The VSX tokens are designed to act as digital royalty tokens instrument tied and correlated to the business performance of the VTube.exhange project. To achieve this, the smart contract uses 80% of the overall fees from the project to buy VSX digital royalty tokens from the market and place them in a zero address, effectively "burning" the tokens and reducing the total supply. This process occurs in real-time and helps to increase the value of the remaining VSX digital royalty tokens.

Pre-mint
The VSX digital royalty token supply does not include a founders' allocation or any reserves for the team or development. Instead, the supply is focused solely on adding value and liquidity to the ecosystem through value-added structures.

Post minting
After the initial minting, VSX tokens can be minted based on equal value being added to the ecosystem. This minting is intended to encourage use of the platform through the reimbursement smart contract and the Router, which helps to increase liquidity and reduce pressure on sales.
 




 Future split
Since VSX has the potential to grow in value significantly, it may become difficult for some investors to justify buying them at their current face value. In this case the DAO may decide to split the tokens, giving users an equal number of VSX tokens with a face value of $0.01. This would not affect the total value of the investors' holdings, but the number of tokens in their wallet would increase proportionally to reflect the split. This split is meant to make it easier for investors to buy VSX and participate in the ecosystem.


Example
1. An investor holds 100 VSX with a face value of $1000. The investors total holdings equals $100,000 (100 x $1,000).
2. VTube.exhange announces a split
3. VSX splits and distributes, to VSX holders, VSX proportionate to the new price.
4. The new price/face value is $0.01. The investor now holds 10,000,000 VSX , still valued at $100,000 (10,000,000 x $0.01).
 
 
Launch plan
Presale via SAFT
The presale of VSX tokens is being conducted through a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) structure, which is compliant with restrictions under US SEC Regulation D 506 (b) and the Securities Act of 1933. This round will be closed to the public and only available to accredited investors. If there is any remaining supply after the presale, it will be added to the post-launch plan to benefit liquidity pools and token holders.


Public sale via IBO
VTube.exhange is using Qwantum Finance Labs' The Initial Bond Offering (IBO) which is a new fundraising model that takes place on the decentralized exchange DEREX. This offering allows investors to purchase tokens at a 50% discount and includes a feature called Secure Floor, which protects against loss in the event of dumping or a "run on the bank" scenario. The IBO is only available to public sale investors who participate in the initial stage when the liquidity pool is not yet open for trading.

Post launch plan
LP insurance
VTube.exhange is using Qwantum Finance Labs' LP Insure technology to encourage new liquidity providers to invest in liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) at any time, without the risk of losing their investment due to dumping or impermanent loss. The LP Insure technology allows LPs to deploy funds that are split into two. Half of the funds are used to purchase VSX tokens directly from the project at the current market price, while the other half is used to create an LP position in the pool. 


The funds received from purchasing tokens directly from the project are not paid to the project or team, but rather are locked in a smart contract vault as insurance to protect the LP from any potential losses. When the LP decides to exit the pool, the insurance will reimburse them for any losses up to 100%. The leftover insurance funds will then be used to purchase VSX tokens from the pool and burn them, which helps to increase the value of the remaining tokens and reduce the overall supply. This process ensures that LPs can invest in liquidity pools without worrying about losing their investment due to market dumping.

ScalePad via PDO
VTube.exhange is using Qwantum Finance Labs' PDO (Psot Dex Offering) new technology which allows VTube.exhange to raise an ongoing funds for the project through the sale of tokens to the community[3]. 100% of the funds raised from the PDO will automatically benefit the token holders, as 50% will be automatically increase the token value and increase the liquidity pool, and 50% will be automatically sent to the Gateway on the Dumper Shield to buyout presale investors, no raising funds will go to the development team or founders.


There are two different types of PDOs available: short term and long term. The short term PDO has a starting price of $0.02 and follows the real-time market price. It also offers a 405.56% APY bonus and has a lock period of 90 days for staked tokens. The long term PDO also has a starting price of $0.02 and follows the real-time market price, but it offers a higher APY bonus of 608.34% and has a longer lock period of 180 days for staked tokens.


PDO terms for Short term
Price: Starts at $0.02 and follows the real time market price[8]
Rewards: 405.56% APY Bonus
Lock period: 90 days locked staking


 
PDO terms for Long term
Price: Starts at $0.02 and follows real time market price
Rewards: 608.34% APY Bonus
Lock period: 180 days locked staking
 
Fundraising Allocation
●     50% of PDO fundraising goes to pools
●     50% of the PDO fundraising goes to buyback early investors behind the dumper shield
 
Dumper Shield
The Dumper Shield is a technology developed by Qwantum Finance Labs that is used by VTube.exhange to prevent token holders who receive tokens at a discount from selling them on the market at a discounted price, which can negatively impact the value of the tokens for other holders. The Dumper Shield provides a way for discounted token holders to sell their tokens without negatively impacting the market value, through the use of a Gateway that regulates the amount of discounted tokens that can be sold. The Gateway only allows a limited number of discounted tokens to be sold, ensuring that the token price is not negatively impacted by more than 50% of the previous day's appreciation. This helps to stabilize the value of the tokens and provide daily liquidity for holders who are behind the Dumper Shield. In addition, the Dumper Shield includes a decentralized over-the-counter (OTC) solution for token holders who want to sell their tokens below the market face value. OTC transactions do not affect the value of the tokens on exchanges or in liquidity pools, and new buyers from the OTC are also added to the Dumper Shield. The Dumper Shield is the world's first decentralized OTC that acts as an exchange for vesting tokens.

Self custody staking
Self-custody staking is a way for VSX token holders to earn additional tokens just by holding the tokens in their own wallet or in a self-custody vault like behind the Dumper Shield. These staking rewards are paid out at regular intervals (determined by the Binance Smart Chain block time, which is approximately 3-5 seconds) simply for holding the tokens. 
The initial annual percentage yield (APY) for staking rewards is ~10%, but this rate can be changed by a vote of the VSX DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). It's important to note that any VSX tokens sent to the self-custody staking contract (which is 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001 address) are considered burned and cannot be recovered for trading, even through voting, without the self-custody staking smart contract. This incentivizes users to hold their VSX in a secure and easily accessible location, such as their own wallet or a self-custody vault.[4]
Trading reward
As part of the go to market VTube.exhange strategy is to inctevice traders with dVoucher reward that subject to the their investment amount. The dVocuher will allow user at any time and at no cost, to cash out at the dVocuher and claim any token in the Qwantum finance labs ecosystem with the same 1:1 face value.
Read about dVoucher 


There are two type of rewards. one is for P2P trades and second is for P2C traders.
P2P trades
Halving reward


P2P (Peer-to-Peer) traders will receive a 250% bonus on their total trading in the first month, but the reward will be halved in the second month to 125%, and will continue to decrease every month over a period of six months, eventually reaching 7.81%.
	P2C traders
Reverse halving reward


P2C (Peer-to-Contract) traders will receive a 7.81% bonus on their total trading in the first month, but the reward will be doubled in the second month to 15.6%, and will continue to increase every month over a period of six months, eventually reaching 250%.

Concept 
The trading reward is designed to first attract P2P (peer-to-peer) traders, with the goal of exposing them to experience the P2C (peer-to-contract) model through RMM (reverse market making).


Supply 
The available supply of dVocuher for trading rewards across all Qwantum Finance Labs RMM exchange is capped at $1 billion or a maximum of 6 months for each new project, whichever limit is reached first.
 
The total reward for a unique user from VTube.exhange is capped at $10,000 dVoucher value.


Keep it fair 
To ensure fairness and prevent abuse by bad actors, dVoucher rewards can only be claimed by buyer wallets that have completed purchases of VSingers on the VTube exhange and hold KYC soulbound tokens from reputable issuers. This way, many users can access rewards, rather than just a few who use fake wallets. Traders who do not currently have a KYC soulbound token on their wallet can still participate by utilizing the Qwantum Finance Labs Reverse KYC process. This means that traders can participate in trading right away and complete their KYC verification at a later date, while their dVoucher rewards are kept on a Reverse KYC special smart contract until their wallet holds a KYC soulbound token. 
Purchases that are still under liquidity protection are not yet considered completed.

EVM 
The VTube.exhange project is designed to support all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchains, including layer 2 scaling solutions. Additionally, if there is enough demand for it, the VSinger.exhange team is open to adapting the code to fit non-EVM based chains such as the Lightning Network for Bitcoin, Cardano, and others.


 Scarcity
VSX is designed to have a limited supply of tokens for trading. tokens from pre-sell, public sale, IBO, and  PDO will be locked for a minimum of 90 days and then will be protected behind the Dumper shield, meaning they will not be able to be frelly traded in the market during that time. This helps to create scarcity of the tokens, which can drive up their value.[5]
DAO
Unlike other projects that rely on centralized voting, the VSinger.exhange operates 100% on the blockchain through DAO voting by its VSX token holders. This ensures that all implementation decisions are made in real time directly by the community and not just the project team.

These developments position Qwantum Finance Labs at the forefront of the future of finance.
RMM sister companies 
VSinger.exhange has sister companies that utilize comparable RMM technology but focus on various industries such as NFT, Metaverse, VTuber, Movies, and Gaming, These sister companies collaborate in terms of traffic and enable VSX token holders to expand their access to liquidity through the Liquidity Router.
Liquidity Router
A Liquidity Route is a smart contract that enables token holders to transfer their tokens from one project within the Qwantum finance Labs ecosystem to another, at a 1:1 $ face value. This allows holders of tokens with limited liquidity on their current project to move them to more liquid projects, reducing the risk of harm to both the project and the holder in the event of an exit. Additionally, as many startups have a high failure rate, it's likely that not all Qwantum finance Labs projects will be successful. The Liquidity Route allows holders to recover some of their loss by moving their tokens to a more successful project. The router works by "burning" the original token and minting a new one with the same value, which is placed under a Dumper Shield as a secondary priority to the "original" tokens on the new project. This means that tokens that were bought directly on a project have higher priority and are engaged with liquidity, while transferred tokens have lower priority.


 Licensing
Qwantum Finance Labs' main go-to-market strategy is a B2B2C model, in which potential partners can apply for white label licensing to benefit from fees and their own branding. This approach is meant to prevent competition from copycat projects and allow the company to focus on end users without having to spend a large amount of time and budget on them.
