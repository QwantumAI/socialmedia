Market overview 
Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and aggregators have become increasingly popular in the cryptocurrency market as they allow users to trade digital assets directly, without the need for intermediaries. However, with the growing number of DEXs and the increasing complexity of the market, it can be difficult for users to find the best prices and trade efficiently. This is where aggregators come in.
Aggregators are platforms that gather information from multiple DEXs to provide users with a unified view of the market and help them find the best prices for their trades. They work by using algorithms to scan multiple DEXs and find the best prices for a given trade. The result is a single, easy-to-use platform that provides users with the best prices and liquidity across multiple DEXs.
While aggregators have been a valuable tool for users, they themselves can be complex and difficult to use. This is why aggregators for aggregators, also known as meta-aggregators, have emerged. Meta-aggregators are platforms that gather information from multiple aggregators, providing users with a single, unified view of the entire market. By aggregating information from multiple aggregators, meta-aggregators provide a more comprehensive view of the market and help users find the best prices and trade efficiently.
In addition to the benefits of a meta-aggregator, a cross-chain meta-aggregator is even better. A cross-chain meta-aggregator has the capability to aggregate information from different blockchain networks, providing users with a unified view of the market across multiple chains. This added level of cross-chain compatibility allows users to access a wider range of digital assets and trade more efficiently, regardless of the blockchain network they are on




Cross-chain meta-aggregator 
The DEGEN platform is a cross-chain meta-aggregator that aims to provide users with the best prices and liquidity for their trades across multiple blockchains and DEXs in the DeFi ecosystem. By being blockchain agnostic, the platform is not limited to a specific blockchain network and can source liquidity from multiple blockchains, regardless of the network.
One of the challenges in the cryptocurrency market is the lack of options for users who want to trade their favorite tokens or use a popular new AMM or DEX. With DEGEN, users can easily swap their liquidity across DEXs with just one click, eliminating the barriers that come with trading on a specific blockchain network.


Crosschain stablecoins with zero fee 
DegenSwap offers users the ability to cross over stablecoins between different EVM chains with zero fees and zero slippage. 




Transaction fee 
DegenSwap charge a swap fee of 0.1% 


All fees can be changed via voting bt the $DEGEN DAO community.
Use of fees breakdown
The fees generated from $DEGEN are used as follows: 80% is used to buy $DEGEN tokens, which increases the value of the token and decreases the total supply. 20% goes to Qwantum Finance Labs as a licensing fee for the $DEGEN technology and to support the project.
100% fee reimbursement
$DEGEN users have the option to receive 100% reimbursement for their gas and fees. To claim these reimbursements, users can use the reimbursement staking contract. To release the reimbursements, users must stake an equal amount of $DEGEN tokens for one year, but they can withdraw partial amounts before the one year period is up. Any remaining balance will accumulate and can be claimed later. 
For example, if a user spends over $1000 on gas and fees over the course of a year, they can be reimbursed for these costs at any time, even if the value of the $DEGEN tokens has increased. The reimbursement staking contract allows users to receive these reimbursements for free and reduces the sale pressure on the secondary market. The rules for the reimbursement staking contract can be changed through DAO voting.




 
DEGEN Tokenomics
Degen v1
DEGEN was originally created to help users that were hurt due to hacking from other platforms and was given, for free, to 13,384 users. https://bscscan.com/token/0xb37b51c5c4c934468b49b55fec15e76c9b538ff3
Transition from v1 to v2 
Qwantum Finance Labs bought the DegenSwap brand to continue its mission to help and support the community.
During transitions, v1 token holders often struggle with notifications, especially with a token like DEGEN that has over 13,884 holders[3], leading some to miss out on transitions. In order to protect against this, DEGEN v1 token holders can swap to DEGEN v2 at any time and at a face value ratio with no additional fee.
In order to protect the new DEGEN v2 token holders, the v1 swap takes place over 365 days and, while swapping, users receive a 10% APY bonus.
 
The transition from v1 to v2 is under the Dumper Shield.
DEGEN v2
The tokenomic structure described below supports a “Buyback and Reward” philosophy which leads to a self-sustainable DAO structure. The $DEGEN token will also support a voting mechanism to facilitate easy proposals, voting, and on-chain execution once the voting systems are completed.
 
Digital Royalty Token
The $DEGEN tokens are designed to act as digital royalty tokens instruments tied and correlated to the business performance of the $DEGEN project. To achieve this, the smart contract uses 80% of the overall fees from the project to buy $DEGEN digital royalty tokens from the market and place them in a zero address, effectively "burning" the tokens and reducing the total supply. This process occurs in real-time and helps to increase the value of the remaining $DEGEN digital royalty tokens.

Pre-mint
The $DEGEN digital royalty token supply does not include a founders' allocation or any reserves for the team or development. Instead, the supply is focused solely on adding value and liquidity to the ecosystem through value-added structures.


Total pre-mint:                                 1,906,145,003




$DEGEN price
Baseline Pre-sale via SAFT:                 $0.01 
Baseline Public sale via IBO:                $0.01
Listing price:                                 $0.02


Post minting
After the initial minting, $DEGEN tokens can be minted based on equal value being added to the ecosystem. This minting is intended to encourage use of the platform through the reimbursement $DEGEN contract and the Router, which helps to increase liquidity and reduce pressure on sales.




Future split
Since $DEGEN has the potential to grow in value significantly, it may become difficult for some investors to justify buying them at their current face value. In this case, the DAO may decide to split the tokens, giving users an equal number of $DEGEN tokens with a face value of $0.01. This would not affect the total value of the investors' holdings, but the number of tokens in their wallets would increase proportionally to reflect the split. This split is meant to make it easier for investors to buy $DEGEN and participate in the ecosystem.


Example
1. An investor holds 100 $DEGEN with a face value of $1000. The investor’s total holdings equal $100,000 (100 x $1,000).
2. DegenSwap announces a split
3. $DEGEN splits and distributes, to $DEGEN holders, $DEGEN proportionate to the new price.
4. The new price/face value is $0.01. The investor now holds 10,000,000 NFTmx, still valued at $100,000 (10,000,000 x $0.01).
 
 


Launch plan
Presale via SAFT
The presale of $DEGEN tokens is being conducted through a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) structure, which is compliant with restrictions under US SEC Regulation D 506 (b) and the Securities Act of 1933. This round will be closed to the public and only available to accredited investors. If there is any remaining supply after the presale, it will be added to the post-launch plan to benefit liquidity pools and token holders.


Public sale via IBO
DegenSwap is using Qwantum Finance Labs' Initial Bond Offering (IBO) which is a new fundraising model that takes place on the decentralized exchange (DEREX). This offering allows investors to purchase tokens at a 50% discount and includes a feature called Secure Floor, which protects against loss in the event of dumping or a "run on the bank" scenario. The IBO is only available to public sale investors who participate in the initial stage when the liquidity pool is not yet open for trading.

Post launch plan
LP insurance
DegenSwap is using Qwantum Finance Labs' LP Insure technology to encourage new liquidity providers to invest in liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) at any time, without the risk of losing their investment due to dumping or impermanent loss. The LP Insure technology allows LPs to deploy funds that are split into two. Half of the funds are used to purchase $DEGEN tokens directly from the project at the current market price, while the other half is used to create an LP position in the pool. 


The funds received from purchasing tokens directly from the project are not paid to the project or team, but rather are locked in a $DEGEN contract vault as insurance to protect the LP from any potential losses. When the LP decides to exit the pool, the insurance will reimburse them for any losses up to 100%. The leftover insurance funds will then be used to purchase $DEGEN tokens from the pool and burn them, which helps to increase the value of the remaining tokens and reduce the overall supply. This process ensures that LPs can invest in liquidity pools without worrying about losing their investment due to market dumping.

ScalePad via PDO
DegenSwap is using Qwantum Finance Labs' PDO (Psot Dex Offering) new technology which allows $DEGEN to raise ongoing funds for the project through the sale of tokens to the community[1]. 100% of the funds raised from the PDO will automatically benefit the token holders, as 50% will be automatically increase the token value and increase the liquidity pool, and 50% will be automatically sent to the Gateway on the Dumper Shield to buyout presale investors, no raising funds will go to the development team or founders.


There are two different types of PDOs available: short term and long term. The short term PDO has a starting price of $0.02 and follows the real-time market price. It also offers a 413.53% APY bonus and has a lock period of 90 days for staked tokens. The long term PDO also has a starting price of $0.02 and follows the real-time market price, but it offers a higher APY bonus of 824.82% and has a longer lock period of 180 days for staked tokens.


PDO terms for Short term
Price: Starts at $0.02 and follows the real time market price[8]
Rewards: 413.53% APY Bonus
Lock period: 90 days locked staking


 
PDO terms for Long term
Price: Starts at $0.02 and follows real time market price
Rewards: 824.82% APY Bonus
Lock period: 180 days locked staking
 
Fundraising Allocation
●     50% of PDO fundraising goes to pools
●     50% of the PDO fundraising goes to buyback early investors behind the dumper shield


Dumper Shield
The Dumper Shield is a technology developed by Qwantum Finance Labs that is used by $DEGEN to prevent token holders who receive tokens at a discount from selling them on the market at a discounted price, which can negatively impact the value of the tokens for other holders. The Dumper Shield provides a way for discounted token holders to sell their tokens without negatively impacting the market value, through the use of a Gateway that regulates the amount of discounted tokens that can be sold. The Gateway only allows a limited number of discounted tokens to be sold, ensuring that the token price is not negatively impacted by more than 50% of the previous day's appreciation. This helps to stabilize the value of the tokens and provide daily liquidity for holders who are behind the Dumper Shield. In addition, the Dumper Shield includes a decentralized over-the-counter (OTC) solution for token holders who want to sell their tokens below the market face value. OTC transactions do not affect the value of the tokens on exchanges or in liquidity pools, and new buyers from the OTC are also added to the Dumper Shield. The Dumper Shield is the world's first decentralized OTC that acts as an exchange for vesting tokens.

Self custody staking
Self-custody staking is a way for $DEGEN token holders to earn additional tokens just by holding the tokens in their own wallet or in a self-custody vault like behind the Dumper Shield. These staking rewards are paid out at regular intervals (determined by the Chain block time, which is approximately a few seconds) simply for holding the tokens. 
The initial annual percentage yield (APY) for staking rewards is ~10%, but this rate can be changed by a vote of the $DEGEN DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). It's important to note that any $DEGEN tokens sent to the self-custody staking contract (which is 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001 address) are considered burned and cannot be recovered for trading, even through voting, without the self-custody staking $DEGEN contract. This incentivizes users to hold their $DEGEN in a secure and easily accessible location, such as their own wallet or a self-custody vault.[2]




Trading reward
As part of the go to market DegenSwap strategy is to incentivize traders with dVoucher rewards that are subject to their investment amount. The dVocuher will allow users at any time and at no cost, to cash out at the dVocuher and claim any token in the Qwantum finance labs ecosystem with the same 1:1 face value.

EVM 
The DegenSwap project is designed to scale to all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchains, including layer 2 scaling solutions. Additionally, if there is enough demand for it, the DegenSwap team is open to adapting the code to fit non-EVM based chains such as the Lightning Network for Bitcoin, Cardano, and others.
 
Scarcity
$DEGEN is designed to have a limited supply of tokens for trading. tokens from pre-sell, public sale, IBO, and  PDO will be locked for a minimum of 90 days and then will be protected behind the Dumper shield, meaning they will not be able to be frelly traded in the market during that time. This helps to create scarcity of the tokens, which can drive up their value.[3]


DAO 
Unlike other projects that rely on centralized voting, the DegenSwap operates 100% on the blockchain through DAO voting by its $DEGEN token holders. This ensures that all implementation decisions are made in real time directly by the community and not just the project team.

These developments position Qwantum Finance Labs at the forefront of the future of finance.
Liquidity Router
A Liquidity Router is a $DEGEN contract that enables token holders to transfer their tokens from one project within the Qwantum finance Labs ecosystem to another, at a 1:1 $ face value. This allows holders of tokens with limited liquidity on their current project to move them to more liquid projects, reducing the risk of harm to both the project and the holder in the event of an exit. Additionally, as many startups have a high failure rate, it's likely that not all Qwantum finance Labs projects will be successful. The Liquidity Route allows holders to recover some of their loss by moving their tokens to a more successful project. The router works by "burning" the original token and minting a new one with the same value, which is placed under a Dumper Shield as a secondary priority to the "original" tokens on the new project. This means that tokens that were bought directly on a project have higher priority and are engaged with liquidity, while transferred tokens have lower priority.
 
Licensing
Qwantum Finance Labs' main go-to-market strategy is a B2B2C model, in which potential partners can apply for white label licensing to benefit from fees and their own branding. This approach is meant to prevent competition from copycat projects and allow the company to focus on end users without having to spend a large amount of time and budget on them.
