Current market overview
Liquidity Providers (LPs) play a crucial role in the functioning of decentralized finance (DeFi) systems, providing liquidity to various protocols and earning rewards in return. However, they are also exposed to a number of risks, some of the most significant risks include:
Impermanent Loss
As described above, impermanent loss occurs when the value of an LP's investment changes relative to the value of the underlying assets they are providing liquidity for. This can occur when the price of one of the assets in the pool deviates significantly from its expected price.


Market Volatility
The price of assets in DeFi protocols can be highly volatile, which can result in significant losses for LPs. This can be exacerbated by the lack of circuit breakers in DeFi protocols, which can lead to sudden drops in asset prices.


Liquidation
If the price of an asset falls below a certain threshold, an LP's position may be automatically liquidated, resulting in a loss. This can happen in a matter of seconds and can be triggered by market volatility or other events.


Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
DeFi protocols are built on smart contracts, which are self-executing programs that run on a blockchain. If a smart contract contains a vulnerability, it can result in losses for LPs.


Rug Pulling
This refers to a malicious act where a project creator or team member abandons the project and sells all of their tokens, causing the price to plummet. LPs who have invested in the project can suffer significant losses as a result.


Bad Actor Interference
DeFi protocols can be vulnerable to hacking, theft, and other forms of interference by bad actors. LPs who have invested in these protocols can lose their investment as a result.










Current LP strategies 
Liquidity Providers (LPs) in decentralized finance (DeFi) are taking various steps to mitigate the risks they are exposed to. Some common strategies include:
Diversification
LPs are diversifying their investments across multiple protocols and assets to reduce the risk of loss from any one investment. This can help to reduce the impact of market volatility and other risks.


Monitoring and Updating Positions
LPs are regularly monitoring their investments and adjusting their positions as needed to reduce the risk of loss. This may involve adding or removing liquidity from certain protocols or adjusting the weighting of different assets in their portfolios.


Using Stop Loss Orders
LPs are using stop loss orders to limit their losses in the event of market volatility or other risks. These orders automatically sell an asset if its price drops below a certain threshold, which can help to limit the impact of losses.


Staying Informed
LPs are staying informed about the latest developments in DeFi and the protocols they have invested in. This includes reading project updates, monitoring social media, and participating in online forums and communities.


Conducting Due Diligence
LPs are conducting thorough due diligence before investing in any DeFi protocol. This includes evaluating the security of the smart contract code, researching the project team and their track record, and evaluating the overall potential of the protocol.


This forces LPs to consider the market's behavior, leading to a game theory mindset where they try to anticipate market trends. Currently, LPs choose to protect themselves from market dumping by cashing out their LP tokens and reinvesting in more stable tokens. However, this action decreases liquidity and drives down the token price, creating a vicious cycle that exacerbates slippage.








Golden cage farming


When a Liquidity Provider (LP) engages in farming rewards that include locking their tokens in a smart contract under a vesting period, they are exposed to a number of risks. Some of the most significant risks include:
Market Volatility
If the price of the asset the LP has invested in changes significantly during the vesting period, the LP's investment can lose value. This can be particularly challenging for LPs who are unable to access their investment for an extended period of time.


Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
 Smart contracts are self-executing programs that run on a blockchain. If a smart contract contains a vulnerability, it can result in loss of funds for LPs who have locked their tokens in the contract.


Farming Reward Uncertainty
The amount of farming rewards an LP can earn may be uncertain and subject to change. This can make it difficult for LPs to accurately evaluate the potential rewards of their investment.


Opportunity Cost
By locking their tokens in a smart contract under a vesting period, LPs are unable to use their investment for other opportunities. This can result in missed opportunities and decreased overall returns.


Liquidity Constraints
If the LP needs to access their funds for an emergency or other unexpected event, they may be unable to do so due to the vesting period. This can result in decreased flexibility and liquidity for the LP.






Security issue
The concept of farming and staking in decentralized finance (DeFi) has raised concerns among regulators, including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), about the potential for these activities to be considered securities offerings.
According to the SEC, an investment contract is considered a security if it meets the criteria established in the Howey Test. This test involves evaluating whether an investment involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with the expectation of profits primarily from the efforts of others.
In the context of DeFi, farming and staking activities may meet the criteria established in the Howey Test and therefore be considered securities offerings. This can result in regulatory issues for the DeFi protocols offering these activities, as well as for the individuals participating in them.
The SEC has taken enforcement actions against several DeFi protocols for conducting unregistered securities offerings, and has issued guidance indicating that some DeFi activities, including those involving the staking offers.






Current insurance barriers
Traditional and cryptocurrency insurance aim to compensate insured individuals for events that may or may not occur. Despite significant investments in statistical analysis, these insurance policies are limited by the funds available in the insurance companies' reserves, which can be depleted during catastrophic events. This often results in a limited number of individuals receiving adequate coverage during black swan events, with many others receiving minimal or no compensation.
The decentralized insurance structures currently available in the market are unable to provide coverage for common trading events such as pump and dumps. These events are a regular occurrence in bull or bear markets and highlight the limitations of DeFi insurance. Moreover, the incentives built into these structures can encourage bad actors to abuse the insurance protection.










NEW LP insurance
The LP insurance offered by Qwantum finance labs operates through the use of bond tokens, which facilitate the prompt settlement of claims between the insurer and the insured. To start the process, the insurer must first generate a bond by depositing project tokens into a smart contract. Once the bond is generated, the insured can then deploy funds into the bond.
Half of the deployed funds are used to directly purchase project tokens without incurring slippage, while the other half is used to create a token pair using cryptocurrencies such as ETH, USDC, or any other token. The proceeds from the project token purchase are not distributed to the project, but rather added to the bond as an insurance reserve. These funds remain in the bond until the insured decides to cash out.
If the value of the token pair is lower than the amount when the bond was created, the bond will automatically trigger the insurance and fully recover the insured's loss. Any remaining funds in the insurance reserve that are not used to recover the insured's loss will be used to buy back project tokens from the pool and destroy them in a deadend address.


Current Method Example:
* User wants to hold $10,000 worth of XYZ<>ETH LP tokens
* User swap $5,000 of ETH for $5,000 worth of XYZ on a DEX, incurring slippage
* User pair the $5,000 worth of XYZ with another $5,000 of ETH to create the LP tokens
* Every time the XYZ token decreases in value, the LP tokens lose ETH
* The LP tokens may become worthless if the XYZ token becomes worthless and no ETH will be left
New LP.Insure Method Example:
* User wants to hold $10,000 worth of XYZ<>ETH LP tokens
* User send $10,000 of ETH to the bond, using $5,000 to purchase $5,000 worth of XYZ from the bond with zero slippage and the remaining $5,000 to pair with the XYZ token
* The bond send to the pool both the ETH and XYZ tokens and receive back the LP tokens
* Every time the XYZ token decreases in value, the LP tokens lose ETH
* The LP tokens may become worthless if the XYZ token becomes worthless and no ETH will be left. BUT when the the user orders the bond to sell the LP tokens, the insurance kicks in and recovers the user's lost ETH up to the original value of $5,000
* Any remaining funds from the insurance (if any) will be used by the bond to purchase additional XYZ tokens from the pool, increasing its value for the community, and burned into a zero address.






Bonds
DEREX utilizes a bond structure based on the ERC-3475 protocol, designed as a semi-fungible and multi-dimensional framework with sub-categories. Instead of sending LP tokens directly to the liquidity provider's wallet, the liquidity provider holds the bond, which holds the LP tokens. 
This structure is designed to improve the benefit for the project and liquidity providers since the bond has built-in solutions, such as farming, discounts, vesting, and dumping protection.


Insurance based on a Quantum finance model
Both the insurer and insured simultaneously hold multiple positions protecting one side of the LP. The insurer and the insured have positive outcomes whether the insurance is claimed or not.


Insurer (Projects)
1. Insurance is claimed if funds are used to recover the protected LP side. In this scenario, it means the project’s token is losing value. By claiming insurance, the LP receives back the exact amount of both LP tokens. Such a scenario protects the project from dumping exposure and creates incentive for LPs not to cash out.
2. Insurance is not claimed if funds do not need to be used to recover LP losses on the protected LP side. The funds that were reserved for protection are used to buyback project tokens from the market and burn them. The automated process grows the market value and reduces supply.
Insured (Users)
1. Insurance is claimed if funds are used to recover the protected LP side. Therefore, users providing LP liquidity will end with no less than their original protected LP side minus the purchase costs of the pair token.
2. IInsurance is not claimed if funds do not need to be used to recover LP losses on the protected LP side. Therefore, the LP benefits from the increased project value as well as the protected LP amount. 






Self custody farming
Project can deploy an insurance bond with a built in farming rewards are incorporated for a designated period, eliminating the need for LP token lock-up in external smart contracts to receive APY. 


Built in vesting 
The bond enables projects to tie their farming rewards to a vesting period, meaning investors cannot sell the LP tokens until the vesting period has ended.


Projects can also create two classes of vesting, one for the principal investment and one for profits, offering early LPs an exit strategy for their principal while keeping profits locked for a longer period.


Additionally, projects can set a prepayment penalty rule for breaking the vesting period, which benefits the community by imposing a fine, for example, a 10% fine on the LP's tokens that will be locked in a dead-end address if the vesting period is broken early.




Bonds OTC
When LP tokens are generated, the bond smart contract holds the LP tokens, while the insured investor holds the bond. The bond can be traded or transferred to other wallets through an over-the-counter (OTC) transaction without activating the insurance or selling the LP tokens.


Bond buyback program
Projects can maintain sustained liquidity by participating in the OTC market through a bond buyback offer using the project token. For instance, the project may offer to purchase the bond from investors by paying 150% of its value in project tokens. To reduce the risk of price dumping, the payouts can be subject to a vesting schedule through the use of a Dumper Shield.

Ongoing Bond Offerings
Projects can raise funds for their liquidity pool all year long in a new way through ongoing Bond Offerings (OBO), designed specifically for projects with existing pools on any DEX on any EVM chain.




3 in 1 bond
LP investors can take advantage of three key features that allow them to purchase tokens at the current market price with no loss in value, earn a high annual percentage yield (APY) through self-custodied farming, and protect their investment from price dumping through decentralized LP insurance without the need for voting or claiming.








FEES
* LP.Insure charges users 2.5% fee when the bond purchased 
* LP.Insure charges projects 2.5% from the insurance leftoover (if any left) after LP been coverd for losses 
EVM 
The LP insure project is designed to scale to all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchains, including layer 2 scaling solutions. Additionally, if there is enough demand for it, the LP insure team is open to adapting the code to fit non-EVM based chains such as the Lightning Network for Bitcoin, Cardano, and others.

Liquidity Router
A Liquidity Router is a smart contract that enables token holders to transfer their tokens from one project within the Qwantum finance Labs ecosystem to another, at a 1:1 $ face value. This allows holders of tokens with limited liquidity on their current project to move them to more liquid projects, reducing the risk of harm to both the project and the holder in the event of an exit. Additionally, as many startups have a high failure rate, it's likely that not all Qwantum finance Labs projects will be successful. The Liquidity Route allows holders to recover some of their loss by moving their tokens to a more successful project. The router works by "burning" the original token and minting a new one with the same value, which is placed under a Dumper Shield as a secondary priority to the "original" tokens on the new project. This means that tokens that were bought directly on a project have higher priority and are engaged with liquidity, while transferred tokens have lower priority.
 
Licensing
Qwantum Finance Labs' main go-to-market strategy is a B2B2C model, in which potential partners can apply for white label licensing to benefit from fees and their own branding. This approach is meant to prevent competition from copycat projects and allow the company to focus on end users without having to spend a large amount of time and budget on them.
