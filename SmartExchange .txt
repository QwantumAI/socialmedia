SmartExchange is a layer zero cross chain based on decentralized bridges that validate by  unlimited validators decentralized community. 


SmartExchange is a decentralized organization managed by a DAO community and created by Qonetum Finance early 2017. The first published pending patent was in 2018 when there was no DeFi awareness. At this time, investors did not even know what slippage was so the solution pre-dated the problem. Now, with the emergence of AMMs and abundance of cross-chain hacks, Smart.Exchange solves a known need in the industry.

SmartPayment
SmartPayment is a PayPal-like solution designed to enable users to interact with decentralized applications (dApps) on different blockchains without the need to exchange their native tokens for the foreign blockchain's native token. This means that users can pay with any digital asset they have, such as cryptocurrency, NFTs, or digital government money, while the dApp recipient receives the currency they require and request. For instance, the SmartPayment solution allows users who hold ETH to use ETH to support projects on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), and these projects can receive BNB instead of ETH.
The SmartPayment solution eliminates the limitations faced by projects that want to host their contract on a specific blockchain while still taking advantage of the benefits offered by more popular chains. This helps to create a more inclusive and accessible ecosystem for dApps and users alike.

SmartWallet
The SmartWallet solution transforms any wallet into an interoperable payment platform instantly. With SmartWallet, users can make payments using any token, while the recipient can receive their preferred token without any additional steps. This provides a seamless and convenient payment experience for both parties.

SMART Bridge
The SmartBridge solution enables the creation of a decentralized, cross-chain bridge for any token, such as SoulBounds or decentralized social media, in a matter of seconds. This cutting-edge technology is accessible to any projects and their users, providing a seamless and efficient way to connect different blockchain networks and facilitate the exchange of tokens. The SmartBridge solution helps to break down barriers between different blockchain networks and promote greater interoperability and collaboration within the decentralized ecosystem


The owner of the token can assume control over the bridge that has been created through the use of a smart contract, becoming the master validator for the bridge. This means that no transactions will occur without the project's approval. In other words, instead of relying on third-party validators, the project has the power to control and act as the master validator for its own token bridge, in addition to the validators provided by other projects in the community

SmartSwap
SmartSwap is a decentralized exchange that provides multichain swaps with a one-click and slippage-free experience. It acts as a decentralized layer ZERO with access to liquidity from all market participants, including centralized exchanges and OTC traders.


SmartSwap uses a zero volatility patent pending method that prevents slippage and reimburses users for fees and gas costs. Instead of choosing the value of a token, users choose the USD face value of the tokens they want to swap, and the exchange prices the tokens based on the average market price. 


SmartSwap also allows for one-click cross-chain swaps between different blockchain networks, without a single point of failure. Currently, SmartSwap supports swaps between BNB, ETH, and Matic, and has the ability to work with any EVM blockchain.

Transaction fee 
Fees are incurred for successful swaps on Smart exchange products. The total fee for smartswap  is 0.30% , smart extenstion is 0.1% , smart wallet 0.1% , smart Bridge 0%


All fees can be changed via voting bt the $SMART DAO community.
The $SMART fees are reimbursed in $SMART tokens through the reimbursement staking  csmart ontract, eliminating any costs for the seller.
Use of fees breakdown
The fees generated from $SMART are used as follows: 80% is used to buy $SMART tokens, which increases the value of the token and decreases the total supply. 20% goes to Qwantum Finance Labs as a licensing fee for the $SMART technology and to support the project.
100% fee reimbursement
$SMART users have the option to receive 100% reimbursement for their gas and fees. To claim these reimbursements, users can use the reimbursement staking contract. To release the reimbursements, users must stake an equal amount of $SMART tokens for one year, but they can withdraw partial amounts before the one year period is up. Any remaining balance will accumulate and can be claimed later. 
For example, if a user spends over $1000 on gas and fees over the course of a year, they can be reimbursed for these costs at any time, even if the value of the $SMART tokens has increased. The reimbursement staking contract allows users to receive these reimbursements for free and reduces the sale pressure on the secondary market. The rules for the reimbursement staking contract can be changed through DAO voting.
Tokenomics
Digital Royalty Token
The $SMART tokens are designed to act as digital royalty tokens instruments tied and correlated to the business performance of the $SMART project. To achieve this, the smart contract uses 80% of the overall fees from the project to buy $SMART digital royalty tokens from the market and place them in a zero address, effectively "burning" the tokens and reducing the total supply. This process occurs in real-time and helps to increase the value of the remaining $SMART digital royalty tokens.

Pre-mint
The $SMART digital royalty token supply does not include a founders' allocation or any reserves for the team or development. Instead, the supply is focused solely on adding value and liquidity to the ecosystem through value-added structures.


Total pre-mint:                                 3,812,290,000[1]




$SMART price
Baseline Pre-sale via SAFT:                 $0.01 
Baseline Public sale via IBO:                $0.01
Listing price:                                 $0.02


Post minting
After the initial minting, $SMART tokens can be minted based on equal value being added to the ecosystem. This minting is intended to encourage use of the platform through the reimbursement $SMART contract and the Router, which helps to increase liquidity and reduce pressure on sales.




Future split
Since $SMART has the potential to grow in value significantly, it may become difficult for some investors to justify buying them at their current face value. In this case, the DAO may decide to split the tokens, giving users an equal number of $SMART tokens with a face value of $0.01. This would not affect the total value of the investors' holdings, but the number of tokens in their wallets would increase proportionally to reflect the split. This split is meant to make it easier for investors to buy $SMART and participate in the ecosystem.


Example
1. An investor holds 100 $SMART with a face value of $1000. The investor’s total holdings equal $100,000 (100 x $1,000).
2. $SMART announces a split
3. $SMART splits and distributes, to $SMART holders, $SMART proportionate to the new price.
4. The new price/face value is $0.01. The investor now holds 10,000,000 NFTmx, still valued at $100,000 (10,000,000 x $0.01).
 
 


Launch plan
Presale via SAFT
The presale of $SMART tokens is being conducted through a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) structure, which is compliant with restrictions under US SEC Regulation D 506 (b) and the Securities Act of 1933. This round will be closed to the public and only available to accredited investors. If there is any remaining supply after the presale, it will be added to the post-launch plan to benefit liquidity pools and token holders.


Public sale via IBO
$SMART is using Qwantum Finance Labs' Initial Bond Offering (IBO) which is a new fundraising model that takes place on the decentralized exchange (DEREX). This offering allows investors to purchase tokens at a 50% discount and includes a feature called Secure Floor, which protects against loss in the event of dumping or a "run on the bank" scenario. The IBO is only available to public sale investors who participate in the initial stage when the liquidity pool is not yet open for trading.

Post launch plan
LP insurance
$SMART is using Qwantum Finance Labs' LP Insure technology to encourage new liquidity providers to invest in liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) at any time, without the risk of losing their investment due to dumping or impermanent loss. The LP Insure technology allows LPs to deploy funds that are split into two. Half of the funds are used to purchase $SMART tokens directly from the project at the current market price, while the other half is used to create an LP position in the pool. 


The funds received from purchasing tokens directly from the project are not paid to the project or team, but rather are locked in a $SMART contract vault as insurance to protect the LP from any potential losses. When the LP decides to exit the pool, the insurance will reimburse them for any losses up to 100%. The leftover insurance funds will then be used to purchase $SMART tokens from the pool and burn them, which helps to increase the value of the remaining tokens and reduce the overall supply. This process ensures that LPs can invest in liquidity pools without worrying about losing their investment due to market dumping.

ScalePad via PDO
$SMART is using Qwantum Finance Labs' PDO (Psot Dex Offering) new technology which allows $SMART to raise ongoing funds for the project through the sale of tokens to the community[2]. 100% of the funds raised from the PDO will automatically benefit the token holders, as 50% will be automatically increase the token value and increase the liquidity pool, and 50% will be automatically sent to the Gateway on the Dumper Shield to buyout presale investors, no raising funds will go to the development team or founders.


There are two different types of PDOs available: short term and long term. The short term PDO has a starting price of $0.02 and follows the real-time market price. It also offers a 413.53% APY bonus and has a lock period of 90 days for staked tokens. The long term PDO also has a starting price of $0.02 and follows the real-time market price, but it offers a higher APY bonus of 824.82% and has a longer lock period of 180 days for staked tokens.


PDO terms for Short term
Price: Starts at $0.02 and follows the real time market price[8]
Rewards: 413.53% APY Bonus
Lock period: 90 days locked staking


 
PDO terms for Long term
Price: Starts at $0.02 and follows real time market price
Rewards: 824.82% APY Bonus
Lock period: 180 days locked staking
 
Fundraising Allocation
●     50% of PDO fundraising goes to pools
●     50% of the PDO fundraising goes to buyback early investors behind the dumper shield


Dumper Shield
The Dumper Shield is a technology developed by Qwantum Finance Labs that is used by $SMART to prevent token holders who receive tokens at a discount from selling them on the market at a discounted price, which can negatively impact the value of the tokens for other holders. The Dumper Shield provides a way for discounted token holders to sell their tokens without negatively impacting the market value, through the use of a Gateway that regulates the amount of discounted tokens that can be sold. The Gateway only allows a limited number of discounted tokens to be sold, ensuring that the token price is not negatively impacted by more than 50% of the previous day's appreciation. This helps to stabilize the value of the tokens and provide daily liquidity for holders who are behind the Dumper Shield. In addition, the Dumper Shield includes a decentralized over-the-counter (OTC) solution for token holders who want to sell their tokens below the market face value. OTC transactions do not affect the value of the tokens on exchanges or in liquidity pools, and new buyers from the OTC are also added to the Dumper Shield. The Dumper Shield is the world's first decentralized OTC that acts as an exchange for vesting tokens.

Self custody staking
Self-custody staking is a way for $SMART token holders to earn additional tokens just by holding the tokens in their own wallet or in a self-custody vault like behind the Dumper Shield. These staking rewards are paid out at regular intervals (determined by the Chain block time, which is approximately a few seconds) simply for holding the tokens. 
The initial annual percentage yield (APY) for staking rewards is ~10%, but this rate can be changed by a vote of the $SMART DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). It's important to note that any $SMART tokens sent to the self-custody staking contract (which is 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001 address) are considered burned and cannot be recovered for trading, even through voting, without the self-custody staking $SMART contract. This incentivizes users to hold their $SMART in a secure and easily accessible location, such as their own wallet or a self-custody vault.[3]




Trading reward
As part of the go to market $SMART strategy is to incentivize traders with dVoucher rewards that are subject to their investment amount. The dVocuher will allow users at any time and at no cost, to cash out at the dVocuher and claim any token in the Qwantum finance labs ecosystem with the same 1:1 face value.

EVM 
The $SMART project is designed to scale to all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchains, including layer 2 scaling solutions. Additionally, if there is enough demand for it, the $SMART team is open to adapting the code to fit non-EVM based chains such as the Lightning Network for Bitcoin, Cardano, and others.
 
Scarcity
$SMART is designed to have a limited supply of tokens for trading. tokens from pre-sell, public sale, IBO, and  PDO will be locked for a minimum of 90 days and then will be protected behind the Dumper shield, meaning they will not be able to be frelly traded in the market during that time. This helps to create scarcity of the tokens, which can drive up their value.[4]


DAO 
Unlike other projects that rely on centralized voting, the $SMART  operates 100% on the blockchain through DAO voting by its $SMART token holders. This ensures that all implementation decisions are made in real time directly by the community and not just the project team.
About Qwantum Finance Labs
Qwantum Finance Labs is a DeFi ecosystem powered by decentralized protocols designed to create an efficient financial system based on quantum finance methods. These methods aim to reduce investment risk and increase liquidity for illiquid and risky assets.
The Qwantum finance labs ecosystem develops innovative solutions such as a decentralized regulation exchange with circuit breakers, Initial Bond Offerings with principal protection, a decentralized index and decentralized SPAC, liquidity protection via reverse market making for Metaverse and NFTs, a new fundraising model for existing projects with investment protection, decentralized dumping insurance for liquidity providers on DEXs, a dumper shield for vesting tokens, among other financial instruments. These developments position Qwantum Finance Labs at the forefront of the future of finance.
Liquidity Router
A Liquidity Router is a $SMART contract that enables token holders to transfer their tokens from one project within the Qwantum finance Labs ecosystem to another, at a 1:1 $ face value. This allows holders of tokens with limited liquidity on their current project to move them to more liquid projects, reducing the risk of harm to both the project and the holder in the event of an exit. Additionally, as many startups have a high failure rate, it's likely that not all Qwantum finance Labs projects will be successful. The Liquidity Route allows holders to recover some of their loss by moving their tokens to a more successful project. The router works by "burning" the original token and minting a new one with the same value, which is placed under a Dumper Shield as a secondary priority to the "original" tokens on the new project. This means that tokens that were bought directly on a project have higher priority and are engaged with liquidity, while transferred tokens have lower priority.
 
Licensing
Qwantum Finance Labs' main go-to-market strategy is a B2B2C model, in which potential partners can apply for white label licensing to benefit from fees and their own branding. This approach is meant to prevent competition from copycat projects and allow the company to focus on end users without having to spend a large amount of time and budget on them.
