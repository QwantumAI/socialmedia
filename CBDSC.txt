What is a CBDC?
A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) is a digital representation of a nation's fiat currency, issued and controlled by its central bank. It represents a technological advancement that holds the potential to enhance efficiency and accessibility within the economy. As such, many central banks globally are currently exploring and assessing the implications of CBDCs on monetary policy, and ways to implement them.
Challenges and issues
CBDCs have the potential to bring many benefits, such as increasing financial inclusion and making transactions more efficient, but also present significant risks and challenges.  For example, CBDCs could bring more competition to commercial banks and affect their funding, but also it could increase the risk of cyber-attacks, money laundering and other financial crimes, It could also impact the monetary policy by giving citizens the ability to move large amounts of money in and out of the financial system at a faster pace. This could affect the monetary policy tools that central banks use to stabilize economies and make it more difficult to achieve financial stability.


The central banking community acknowledges that CBDCs pose a number of challenges and issues that must be carefully considered, including:


1. Technical challenges: Developing a secure and efficient infrastructure for the issuance, distribution, and use of CBDCs is a complex and technically challenging task. This includes ensuring the scalability, security, and privacy of the system.
2. Risk to financial stability: The widespread adoption of CBDCs could have a significant impact on financial stability, particularly if they lead to a run on deposits or a shift in funding from bank to central bank.
3. Impact on monetary policy: CBDCs could affect the transmission mechanism of monetary policy, making it more difficult for central banks to influence interest rates and inflation.
4. Legal and regulatory challenges: The development and use of CBDCs raise a number of legal and regulatory issues, such as issues related to anti-money laundering, combating the financing of terrorism, and data privacy.
5. Cybersecurity: CBDCs could be vulnerable to cyber-attacks and fraud, which could undermine public confidence in the system and lead to significant financial losses.
6. International coordination: The development and use of CBDCs could be affected by different regulations and standards in different countries, so international coordination and cooperation is needed.
7. Socio-economic issues: The large-scale adoption of digital currencies may bring about important changes in the way that monetary policy operates, for example, it could make it harder for central banks to implement negative interest rates, but also it could support more financial inclusion and more easy access to basic banking services.
8. Privacy concerns: The use of a digital currency can raise privacy concerns as it could allow central banks and other authorities to have more visibility on the financial activities of individuals, also with the addition of privacy-preserving technologies like zero-knowledge proof, this challenge can be mitigate.


Quantum problem 
One of the most significant challenges facing CBDCs that is yet to be fully examined by issuers is the delicate balance between centralization and decentralization. On one hand, CBDC issuers intend to retain centralized control over monetary policy, but on the other hand, digital money has the potential to democratize the financial system, resulting in a decentralized, open market where the value of the currency is determined by main street market forces, not by wall street. This creates a tension between the desire for centralized control and the reality of a decentralized system. It's a complex challenge that cannot be resolved through traditional methods.


TAIL RISK is approaching 
As observed, traders who invest in speculative assets such as cryptocurrencies often utilize stablecoins as a means of avoiding volatility, which can lead to ongoing events of depegging. For example, when the value of Bitcoin drops, traders may be willing to purchase stablecoins at a premium (e.g. $1.01, $1.02, or even $1.05) in order to mitigate potential losses from staying exposed to the volatility of Bitcoin. Conversely, when the value of Bitcoin increases, these same traders may be willing to sell their stablecoins at a discount (e.g. $0.99, $0.98, or even $0.95) in order to take advantage of the uptrend before it's too late.
This phenomenon, where traders act in their own self-interest, can lead to significant volatility and has the potential to threaten global financial stability. 
While Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has the potential to democratize various industries and open up new investment opportunities through simple, one-click engagement, it's reasonable to assume that users who invest in various sectors like art, music, gaming, real estate, and others will prefer to use CBDCs issued by governments, over stablecoins issued by private companies. Therefore, it is also reasonable to assume that even a fraction of these public traders could have a significant impact on the value of CBDCs which will be traded between end-users on a 24/7 basis..
Quantum finance solution 
Our team at Qwantum Finance Labs has developed a patent pending groundbreaking solution that utilizes quantum finance techniques to improve the security of CBDCs. We have named this solution CBDSC (Central Bank Digital SECURE Coin). 


By implementing CBDSC, issuers are able to maintain centralized control over monetary policy, while enabling the decentralized forces of the marketplace to trade the digital currency at any location and at any time, providing the best of both worlds in terms of centralization and decentralization.
Decentralized clearinghouses and settlements protocol 
Unlike traditional clearinghouses that require participants such as banks to hold deposits or collateral to cover potential obligations in the event of a default, and also unlike blockchain-based solutions like the Ripple protocol that facilitates cross-border money transfers but has a high degree of centralization within its network. The technology behind CBDCs includes the world's first fully decentralized patent pending clearinghouse and settlements protocol that does not require reserves and has no centralized components (not even validators or a voting system) and can be used by any holder of CBDC, including issuers, banks, institutions, and individual users.
What else CBDSC can solve? 
CBDCs can implement a variety of solutions to meet the needs of central banks, including those that address issues such as inflation and deflation, lost funds recovery, protection against bad actors and hacking, compliance with KYC/AML regulations through zero-knowledge proof, privacy and surveillance, tax collection and encouraging spending. Additionally, branding, and other specific needs can also be met. These solutions aim to strike a balance between central bank's need for control and oversight, while also leveraging the unique capabilities of digital currencies to provide benefits to users and the economy as a whole.
