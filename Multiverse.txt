Multiverse Whitepaper v.2.1


 


 
Current Market Overview
The current market for metaverse based non-fungible tokens (lands) is facing several challenges. One of these challenges is the need for a marketplace to trade virtual lands, similar to eBay or zillow. However, these marketplaces can be vulnerable to fraud and low volume, which can hinder liquidity. In addition, there is the risk of scammers manipulating the market by using multiple wallets and transactions to artificially inflate the price of their own lands and then selling them to unsuspecting buyers at a premium. This can erode community trust and decrease speculation and buying.
Even if a marketplace is free of fraud and scams, it is still likely to face other issues. P2P galleries, like OpenSea, may become overcrowded and resemble stock photo sites or app stores with a vast number of offerings. This could make it difficult for creators and investors to sell their lands or land collections, as they may struggle to gain the visibility and promotion needed to succeed. The market may become dominated by a small number of influencers or celebrities who are able to generate the necessary hype to sell their lands.
Obsolete land collection potential
Furthermore, as the number of land collections increases, some may not survive and become obsolete. While floor prices are meant to provide protection, high fluctuation can lead to potential "run on the bank" scenarios where lands holders end up with worthless assets.
Obsolete metaverse potential
With the rise of multiple projects creating their own metaverses and offering digital land as assets, it is becoming increasingly difficult to predict which metaverse will come out on top. Much like the competition between early search engines or browsers, only a select few will survive while the rest become obsolete. The market is currently seeing major players such as Mark Zuckerberg's Meta and Microsoft entering the space, as well as many unknown entities yet to be revealed. It is challenging to determine which metaverse will dominate the market, but it is likely that once the winners and losers are identified, many lands within the less successful metaverses will become worthless.


Needs for a better metaverse marketplace 
There is a need for a better metaverse marketplace that addresses several issues currently facing the market. One of these issues is the need to generate sustainable liquidity for sellers, regardless of market conditions. This means that sellers should be able to easily buy and sell their lands even when the market is experiencing downturns or volatility.
Another need is to create a marketplace that provides equal opportunity for all sellers, regardless of their level of promotion or recognition. This includes providing opportunities for new and unknown creators to sell their lands and generate income streams from their intellectual property.
The marketplace should also work to eliminate scams and pump and dump schemes, which can manipulate the market and harm honest sellers and buyers. By providing a safe and transparent marketplace, it will be possible to increase confidence and trust in the market, which can in turn drive increased liquidity and buying pressure.
Multiverse is a metaverse decentralized exchange that aims to address all the challenges facing the market, including the need for sustainable liquidity, buy pressure, and the removal of pump and dump schemes. It does this by using quantum finance models to create the world's first land based on 100% liquidity protection through techniques such as Reverse Market Making, Decentralized Venture Capital, and IP income stream generation.
Unlike other NFT marketplaces, which are often centralized and built as Peer-to-Peer (P2P) platforms, Multiverse is the world's first decentralized metaverse exchange to support both Peer-to-Contract (P2C) and Contract-to-Contract (C2C) transactions. This decentralized approach is meant to provide additional security and transparency for buyers and sellers.


Quantum Finance
Quantum finance is a new field that uses theories and methods developed by quantum physicists and economists to solve problems in finance. It is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which describe how particles behave at the atomic and subatomic levels. Unlike traditional binary methods, which are based on two positions (0 and 1, false and true) and often result in a zero-sum game with high risk and limited possibilities, quantum finance introduces multiple positions that can significantly reduce risk and create liquidity even for non-liquid assets.
Multiverse applies quantum finance principles in a way that allows investors to simultaneously hold two contradictory positions: one as a buyer and owner of an land, and another as a non-buyer and non-owner. This allows investors to potentially profit from their investments and then decide whether to finalize the transaction as a buyer or walk away, depending on how the market develops.
Although quantum finance is a relatively new field, the team behind Multiverse believes that it has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about finance and investment. They are proud to be among the first to bring this concept to the blockchain.


Reverse Market Making 
Reverse Market Making (RMM) is a liquidity solution that was designed to boost the non-fungible token (NFT) industry in a similar way to how Automated Market Making (AMM) has helped the cryptocurrency market during the 2019 bullrun. AMM has been used by decentralized exchanges (DEXs) such as Uniswap and Pancakeswap to provide liquidity to brand new projects from the start, without the barriers of traditional centralized exchanges (CEXs). It has also paved the way for the development of new lending, options, and derivative protocols, which are now an important part of the decentralized financial ecosystem.
RMM works by creating instant liquidity for any land through a smart contract, without the need for a counterparty buyer. It allows buyers to reverse their trade back to the smart contract like it was a refund or cancellation order, while the seller acts as the market maker and benefits from the trade-off regardless of the outcome. This liquidity solution provides protection for buyers during the period of liquidity protection.


100% Liquidity protection
Lands and land collections can be difficult to trade due to scalability issues, limited liquidity, and higher risks for investors. These risks are exacerbated by bad actors who promote assets through manipulating their value and demand using fake wallets, and the lack of a guarantee of liquidity for sellers.
To address these issues, Multiverse designed a 100% liquidity protection solution for buyers. This means that sellers can act as market makers by offering buyers protection for a certain period of time, during which buyers have the option to return the land to the smart contract and receive back the exact protected value in the same tokens that they invested with. This protection is available regardless of market conditions, helping to reduce the risk for buyers and making it easier for them to trade lands.[1]




example 
* Bob wants to sell his land for $1,000 and earn a reward as a market maker
* Bob uses Reverse Market Making (RMM) for liquidity protection for 90 days in exchange for a 5% slippage fee
* Bob earns 5% profit over 90 days, equating to a 20% annual percentage yield (APY) even in the event of a cancelled sale
* Lisa decides to purchase Bob's land and transfers funds to a Liquidity Protection smart contract
* Lisa only has to pay $1,000 to Bob if the transaction is finalized
* Lisa has the option to reverse the transaction and receive a full refund if market conditions deteriorate or she can't resell land, minus any fees and slippage




Earning from making the market
Sellers who act as market makers utlzing the RMM have the opportunity to earn rewards in two ways: through slippage and by leveraging staking.
Slippage reward
Slippage reward is a form of compensation that sellers can request in exchange for offering a liquidity protection period. The amount of slippage is disclosed to and agreed upon by the buyer before the transaction takes place, and it is fixed rather than being unpredictable like it is on some decentralized exchanges (DEXs).
Leveraging staking 
Alternatively or in addition to slippage, sellers can offer buyers low or even zero slippage in exchange for the opportunity to leverage the buyer's funds on a third-party decentralized protocol to generate passive income through annual percentage yield (APY). This can reduce the cost for the buyer to zero and provide the seller with enough reward to justify acting as a market maker. In both cases, the initial principal from the purchase is secured in a smart contract vault and is not sent to the seller until the sale is finalized.[2]
Development strategy to earn during the protection period
Developers can take advantage of liquidity protection periods by acquired land to generate income streams. Even if the buyer chooses to cancel their order and receive a full refund, they will still be able to keep any income generated during the protection period. This strategy incentivizes developers to acquire land and experiment with building on it and generating income streams before making a decision on whether to keep or return the land based on the cost-effectiveness of the land's income compared to its cost.


Benefits for sellers and buyers utilizing RMM
There are several benefits for both sellers and buyers to utlize the RMM solution. Sellers can potentially increase their conversion rate and provide equal opportunities to new and unknown metaverse creators by offering liquidity protection. They can also earn rewards as market makers regardless of the sale outcome, and if they choose to leverage staking, they can keep any APY staking rewards earned. This earning while selling concept is similar to a traditional lease-to-own concept in the real estate industry.
Buyers, on the other hand, can hedge their investments and explore higher-risk and potentially lucrative new opportunities with the knowing that they can always reverse the trade back to the smart contract like it was a cancellation or refund without any tax triggers if they are unable to sell the land to a new buyer. If a buyer agrees to a slippage reward, they will only pay it if they cancel the transaction and receive a full refund. If the seller is leveraging staking, the buyer does not have to pay anything in exchange for the liquidity protection; instead, the seller is paid by a third-party decentralized staking protocol such as Curve, Venus, or Yearn Finance.




Liquidity protection process
The liquidity protection process is a way for sellers to offer buyers protection against potential losses that may occur when buying and selling assets. The process involves the use of non-fungible tokens (lands) to represent the protection offered to buyers.
Step 1 - Offering
sellers offer buyers 100% liquidity protection for a specified number of days, and select a reward for the protection based on slippage or leverage staking.


Step 2 - Selection
buyers can select an land that provides the desired liquidity protection and reward.


Step 3 - Sale and protection period
the slippage reward is sent to the seller immediately and is non-refundable. The funds covered by the liquidity protection are locked in a smart contract and, if the seller has offered liquidity protection with leverage staking, are also transferred to decentralized protocols like yearn.finance or Venus to generate passive annual percentage yield (APY) as a reward for the seller.


Step 4 - Buyer revokes liquidity protection
buyers have the option to revoke the liquidity protection by returning the land to the seller's liquidity protection smart contract. This triggers a full refund of the protected funds in the original token used by the buyer. If the transaction included leverage staking, the seller will receive the APY market making rewards and the buyer will receive their protected funds from the decentralized protocols in the form of a wrapped token (such as cUSDC or vUSDC).
Alternatively, if the land is not returned to the liquidity protection contract during the protection period, the seller can claim payment from the smart contract once the period expires, indicating a successful sale.


Seller use case 
-       Imagine a seller of 1,000 different lands
-       The seller offers all 1,000 lands for $1,000 each (worth $1,000,000 total)
Thos lands are protected by liquidity protection in exchange for leveraging staking or fix slippage
-       Once received, the $1,000,000 received by the contract, it is automatically sent to Venus and/or yearn.finance with an average 10% APY or stay in the vault in exchange for immediate fixed slippage of let’s say 10%
-       During the protection period 95% of the lands are canceled and 5% are sold
-       For the 5% lands sold, the seller receives the full payment of $50K and the buyer receives back the land’s
-       The funds for the remaining 95% of the land’s that were canceled are returned to the buyer and the lands to the seller.
-       During this period, the seller generated APY above the $1,000,000 value of the lands, equal to $100,000
-       The total profit for the seller is $150,000 ($50,000 for the sold lands+ $100,000 reward) representing 300% ROI over 50K sold land supply.


Unlimited Liquidity protection layers
RMM designed to increase liquidity and demand for lands in the same way that the Bill of Exchange, a financial instrument from the 17th century, increased liquidity for money. When a buyer purchases an land with liquidity protection via RMM, the protection acts as collateral for the buyer. This means that the buyer can then sell the same lan to another buyer with liquidity protection, potentially at a higher price, and earn a profit. This process can be repeated multiple times, with the land being resold to successive buyers with liquidity protection, potentially resulting in increased trading volume and value for the land. The number of times the land can be resold in this way is unlimited.
Incentives for buyers to create a buy pressure 
There are several incentives for buyers to create buying pressure for land via RMM (Reserve Market Making) and retain or resell them in the future, such as:
1. Buyers can register themselves as future owners under the multilevel ownership, even if they bought and sold the land at a higher, same, or lower price.
2. Buyers can earn market-making rewards that are larger than the rewards they pay to their sellers.
3. Buyers can at any time fork their land and create derivatives or sub-collections, and then conduct an initial offering, but  they  can only claim the profits generated from these sales once their liquidity protection period has expired, as an alternative they can also sell the land along with underlying locked profits from the sub-collections to the next buyer.


Example of cancellation 
* Bob purchases an land from the creator for $100, with a 100-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 5% slippage.
* Lisa then purchases the same land from Bob for $200, with a 90-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 10% slippage (Bob is instantly compensated for this slippage). 
* Peter then purchases the land from Lisa for $400, with a 60-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 2% slippage (Lisa is instantly compensated for this slippage).
* After 30 days, Peter cancels his purchase and receives a full refund of $400 minus the slippage and fees. The land is returned to Lisa, and the system automatically relists it for resale under the same terms as before. 
* If no new buyer is found, Lisa has the option to keep the land or trigger her liquidity protection and return it to Bob, in exchange for a full refund of $200 minus the slippage and fees. 
* Once Bob receives the land, the system automatically relists it for resale under the same terms as before. If it remains unsold, Bob has the option to keep it or trigger the liquidity protection and return it to the creator in exchange for  full refund of $100 minus the slippage and fees.


In this scenario, none of the buyers in the liquidity protection layers are exposed to any principal loss. At the same time, each buyer who acts as a seller is rewarded as a market-making via slippage compensation, including the creator.






Example of completion
* Bob purchases an land from the creator for $100, with a 100-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 5% slippage (the creator is instantly compensated for this slippage).
* Lisa then purchases the same land from Bob for $200, with a 90-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 10% slippage (Bob is instantly compensated for this slippage). 
* Peter then purchases the land from Lisa for $400, with a 60-day liquidity protection, in exchange for a 2% slippage (Lisa is instantly compensated for this slippage).
* After 60 days have passed, the liquidity protection for Peter has expired. As a result, Peter retains the land and all the sellers, including the creator, can claim their sales profits from the smart contract.








Multiverse vs Opensea 
Opensea is comparable to a centralized crypto exchange that operates on a peer-to-peer model, whereas Multiverse is more akin to a decentralized exchange that relies on peer-to-contract transactions.


Comparing example for seller
OpenSea peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplace
* Bob has 1,000 land assets for sale at $1,000 each, totaling $1,000,000
* Bob lists his assets on OpenSea with a 5% conversion sale rate
* Bob receives $50,000 for selling his assets
* While the remaining $950,000 worth of assets do not sell




Multiverse Peer-to-Contract (P2C) decentrlzed exchange 
* Bob has the same 1,000 land assets for sale at $1,000 each, totaling $1,000,000
* Bob lists his assets with liquidity protection for 365 days and 95% cancellation rate (5% actual sale rate)
* Bob receives $50,000 for selling his land assets, plus
* Bob also receives an additional $95,000 from generating 10% slippage or APY over $950,000 worth of assets that did not sell
* Bob's total reward is 290% more than on a peer-to-peer marketplace like OpenSea


Comparing example for buyer
OpenSea - Peer-to-Peer (P2P) 
-          Lisa purchased land for $1,000 
-          Lisa can’t find a buyer for her land and she left with zero sum game. Meaning the $1000 
land has no value.
Multiverse - Peer-to-Contract  (P2C)
-          Lisa purchased land for $1,000 
-          Lisa can’t find a buyer for her land so she return it back to the liquidity protection smart 
contract and get a full 100% refund (minus Multiverse 2.5% transaction fee and pre agreed slippage if exist) if Lisa agreed to liquidity leverage instead of slippage reward, then Lisa will get all her investment back fully (minus Multiverse 2.5% transaction fee)


Liquidity for other P2P marketplaces
Lands that have been protected via RMM can be also sold on Peer-to-Peer (P2P) basic marketplaces such as Opensea and SuperRare.
The liquidity protection feature remains linked to the land even after it is sold, so that future buyers on other platforms can return the land to the liquidity protection smart contract on multiverse. This allows for the land to continue being protected even if it is resold multiple times on different platforms.


14-day days cancellation law
The US 14-day cooling-off period and the Europe 14-day right of withdrawal, as consumer protection laws, can pose risks for land sellers in the form of cancellations and class action lawsuits. These laws give consumers the right to cancel a sale and receive a refund within a specified time frame, which could result in financial losses for land sellers, as they may need to refund the purchase price for lands that have already been sold.
In addition, land sellers could be exposed to class action lawsuits if they fail to comply with these laws. For example, if a large number of consumers claim that their rights under the cooling-off period or right of withdrawal were violated, they could band together and bring a class action lawsuit against the land seller. This could result in significant legal expenses, as well as financial damages if the land seller is found to have violated the law.
It is important for land sellers to be aware of the relevant consumer protection laws in their jurisdiction, and to ensure that they comply with these laws in their land sales activities. This may include incorporating the provisions of the cooling-off period and right of withdrawal into land sales contracts and providing consumers with clear and concise information about their rights under these laws.
The current marketplaces, such as OpenSea may be considered facilitators or intermediaries in land sales, rather than direct sellers of lands. In some cases, this could limit the marketplaces' exposure to consumer protection laws such as the cooling-off period or right of withdrawal, as the primary responsibility for complying with these laws would lie with the land seller.
However, depending on the jurisdiction and the specific provisions of each law, OpenSea could still be exposed to class action lawsuits if consumers claim that their rights under the cooling-off period or right of withdrawal were violated. For example, if a large number of consumers claim that the land sellers on OpenSea violated their rights under these laws, they could band together and bring a class action lawsuit against OpenSea.








More innovations 
Automated Decentralized Syndication 
Multiverse’s Automated Decentralized Syndication (ADS) allows any buyer or seller to pool funds together to purchase an land and automatically resell it for a profit. ADS acts as the owner of the land and each ADS can only be used for one land . All members of the ADS have an equal share based on their investment amount, and can claim their profits or refunded principal at any time without authorization from other investors. ADS provides is a security compliant, efficient, and scalable solution for group purchasing of lands, avoiding the security risks and potential deadlock of tokenized tokens that can occur with other syndication models.


Multilevel ownership
The multilevel ownership contract allows sellers to continue earning passive income from the sale of their assets even after the asset has been resold multiple times. This means that the asset will continue to generate profits for its previous owners. The income from each new sale is split proportionally among all current owners in real-time. This solution is fully decentralized and works even if the asset is listed and sold on exchanges that do not support this model.

Initial Land Offering
Multiverse enables lands creators to launch Initial Land Offerings (ILO) with their collection. ILOs can be offered at a fixed price or as an auction.
Utilizing the Multilevel Ownership smart contract, ILOs can provide 100% liquidity protection with an additional higher slippage fee, paid instantly to the issuer, plus an extra higher ownership fee for perpetuity every time the NFT is sold forward. 
This structure offers greater protection to buyers compared to traditional ILOs while generating more revenue for the issuer.
 
Example
Let's say metaverse issuer wants to launch an ILO for collection of 10,000 lands at a fixed price of $100 per land. Instead of using a traditional ILO that can generate $1,000,000 in sales, the issuer decides to utilize a 50% Multilevel Ownership smart contract with 100% liquidity protection and a 25% slippage fee.
* The issuer will instantly receive $250,000 ($100 x 25% x 10,000 lands), while the rest of the funds ($750,000) stay pending.
* When the first buyer of a land resells it for $200, the issuer will receive an extra $500,000 (($200 - $100) x 50% x 10,000 lands) as the multilevel ownership fee.
* When the second buyer of a land resells it for $400, the issuer will receive an extra $1,000,000 (($400 - $200) x 50% x 10,000 lands) as the multilevel ownership fee.
* And when the third buyer of a land resells it for $800, the issuer will receive an extra $2,000,000 (($800 - $200) x 50% x 10,000 lands) as the multilevel ownership fee.
In total, the issuer has received $3,750,000 from the multilevel ownership and liquidity protection, with an extra $750,000 pending. This is 400% higher than a traditional ILO.
Transaction fee 
When a purchase is made on Multiverse, a 2.5% transaction fee is immediately applied. After the fee is applied, the seller will receive the remaining amount once the transaction is no longer under protection. If the seller charges a slippage fee, it will be calculated based on the remaining amount after the Multiverse transaction fee. For example, if the sale price is $100, the seller will be eligible for $97.5. If the seller charges a 10% slippage fee, they will receive $9.75 immediately, and the remaining $87.75 will be locked under the liquidity protection contract. 
The Multiverse fees are reimbursed in Multiverse tokens through the reimbursement staking smart contract, eliminating any costs for the seller.
Cancelation fee
If a buyer returns an land to the liquidity protection contract, the sale fee that was originally paid by the seller becomes a cancellation fee that is paid by the buyer. For example, if the sale price is $100 and the Multiverse fee is 2.5%, the buyer's liquidity protection will be $97.5. If the seller charges a 10% slippage fee, the buyer will receive a refund of $87.75. 
The Multiverse fees are reimbursed in Multiverse tokens through the reimbursement staking smart contract, eliminating any costs for the buyer.


Use of fees breakdown
The fees generated from Multiverse are used as follows: 80% is used to buy Multiverse tokens, which increases the value of the token and decreases the total supply. 20% goes to Qwantum Finance Labs as a licensing fee for the Multiverse technology and to support the project.
100% fee reimbursement
Multiverse users have the option to receive 100% reimbursement for their gas and fees. To claim these reimbursements, users can use the reimbursement staking contract. To release the reimbursements, users must stake an equal amount of Multiverse tokens for one year, but they can withdraw partial amounts before the one year period is up. Any remaining balance will accumulate and can be claimed later. 
For example, if a user spends over $1000 on gas and fees over the course of a year, they can be reimbursed for these costs at any time, even if the value of the Multiverse tokens has increased. The reimbursement staking contract allows users to receive these reimbursements for free and reduces the sale pressure on the secondary market. The rules for the reimbursement staking contract can be changed through DAO voting.


P2P Lands with 0% fee
In addition to the innovative solutions offered by Multiverse it also enables users to conduct standard peer-to-peer transactions (without liquidity protection) that are offered by other NFT marketplaces, such as OpenSea, Uniswap, and others, at no charge and with 0% fees.


Tokenomics
Digital Royalty Token
The VRS tokens are designed to act as digital royalty tokens (DRT) instrument tied and correlated to the business performance of the Multiverse project. To achieve this, the smart contract uses 80% of the overall fees from the project to buy VRS digital royalty tokens from the market and place them in a zero address, effectively "burning" the tokens and reducing the total supply. This process occurs in real-time and helps to increase the value of the remaining VRS digital royalty tokens. 
Digital Royalty Tokens vs simple tokens
Digital Royalty Tokens (DRT ) are different from regular tokens in that they have an underlying value that is derived from the income stream of a project. This means that the value of DRT tokens is not solely based on speculation, like regular tokens often are. Instead, the value of DRT tokens is based on the real-time traction and success of the project they represent.
As a result, DRT tokens may be more resistant to market downturns than regular tokens. Even when the market is crashing and the value of other tokens based on speculation is decreasing, DRT tokens may still hold value because they have a potential return on investment based on their proven income stream. Buyers may be attracted to DRT tokens in a down market because they see the potential for the value of the token to increase based on the project's performance.
Pre-mint
The VRS digital royalty token supply does not include a founders' allocation or any reserves for the team or development. Instead, the supply is focused solely on adding value and liquidity to the ecosystem through value-added structures.

Post minting
After the initial minting, VRS tokens can be minted based on equal value being added to the ecosystem. This minting is intended to encourage use of the platform through the reimbursement smart contract and the Router, which helps to increase liquidity and reduce pressure on sales.


VRS price
Baseline Pre-sale via SAFT:                 $0.01 
Baseline Public sale via IBO:                $0.01
Listing price:                                 $0.02


Future split
Since VRS has the potential to grow in value significantly, it may become difficult for some investors to justify buying them at their current face value. In this case, VRS may decide to split the tokens, giving users an equal number of VRS tokens with a face value of $0.01. This would not affect the total value of the investors' holdings, but the number of tokens in their wallets would increase proportionally to reflect the split. This split is meant to make it easier for investors to buy VRS  and participate in the ecosystem.


Example
1. An investor holds 100 VRS  with a face value of $1000. The investor’s total holdings equal $100,000 (100 x $1,000).
2. Multiverse announces a split
3. VRS  splits and distributes, to VRS holders, VRS proportionate to the new price.
4. The new price/face value is $0.01. The investor now holds 10,000,000 VRS , still valued at $100,000 (10,000,000 x $0.01).
 
 Launch plan
Presale via SAFT
The presale of VRS tokens is being conducted through a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFT) structure, which is compliant with restrictions under US SEC Regulation D 506 (b) and the Securities Act of 1933. This round will be closed to the public and only available to accredited investors. If there is any remaining supply after the presale, it will be added to the post-launch plan to benefit liquidity pools and token holders.


Public sale via IBO
Multiverse is using Qwantum Finance Labs' The Initial Bond Offering (IBO) which is a new fundraising model that takes place on the decentralized exchange DEREX. This offering allows investors to purchase tokens at a 50% discount and includes a feature called Secure Floor, which protects against loss in the event of dumping or a "run on the bank" scenario. The IBO is only available to public sale investors who participate in the initial stage when the liquidity pool is not yet open for trading.

Multiverse is using Qwantum Finance Labs' LP Insure technology to encourage new liquidity providers to invest in liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) at any time, without the risk of losing their investment due to dumping or impermanent loss. The LP Insure technology allows LPs to deploy funds that are split into two. Half of the funds are used to purchase VRS tokens directly from the project at the current market price, while the other half is used to create an LP position in the pool. The funds received from purchasing tokens directly from the project are not paid to the project or team, but rather are locked in a smart contract vault as insurance to protect the LP from any potential losses. When the LP decides to exit the pool, the insurance will reimburse them for any losses up to 100%. The leftover insurance funds will then be used to purchase VRS tokens from the pool and burn them, which helps to increase the value of the remaining tokens and reduce the overall supply. This process ensures that LPs can invest in liquidity pools without worrying about losing their investment due to market dumping.

ScalePad via PDO
Multiverse is using Qwantum Finance Labs' PDO (Psot Dex Offering) new technology which allows Multiverse to raise an ongoing funds for the project through the sale of tokens to the community[3]. 100% of the funds raised from the PDO will automatically benefit the token holders, as 50% will be automatically increase the token value and increase the liquidity pool, and 50% will be automatically sent to the Gateway on the Dumper Shield to buyout presale investors, no raising funds will go to the development team or founders.


There are two different types of PDOs available: short term and long term. The short term PDO has a starting price of $0.02 and follows the real-time market price. It also offers a 405.56% APY bonus and has a lock period of 90 days for staked tokens. The long term PDO also has a starting price of $0.02 and follows the real-time market price, but it offers a higher APY bonus of 608.34% and has a longer lock period of 180 days for staked tokens.


PDO terms for Short term
Price: Starts at $0.02 and follows the real time market price[8]
Rewards: 405.56% APY Bonus
Lock period: 90 days locked staking


 
PDO terms for Long term
Price: Starts at $0.02 and follows real time market price
Rewards: 608.34% APY Bonus
Lock period: 180 days locked staking
 
Fundraising Allocation
●     50% of PDO fundraising goes to pools
●     50% of the PDO fundraising goes to buyback early investors behind the dumper shield
 
Dumper Shield
The Dumper Shield is a technology developed by Qwantum Finance Labs that is used by Multiverse to prevent token holders who receive tokens at a discount from selling them on the market at a discounted price, which can negatively impact the value of the tokens for other holders. The Dumper Shield provides a way for discounted token holders to sell their tokens without negatively impacting the market value, through the use of a Gateway that regulates the amount of discounted tokens that can be sold. The Gateway only allows a limited number of discounted tokens to be sold, ensuring that the token price is not negatively impacted by more than 50% of the previous day's appreciation. This helps to stabilize the value of the tokens and provide daily liquidity for holders who are behind the Dumper Shield. In addition, the Dumper Shield includes a decentralized over-the-counter (OTC) solution for token holders who want to sell their tokens below the market face value. OTC transactions do not affect the value of the tokens on exchanges or in liquidity pools, and new buyers from the OTC are also added to the Dumper Shield. The Dumper Shield is the world's first decentralized OTC that acts as an exchange for vesting tokens.

Self custody staking
Self-custody staking is a way for VRS token holders to earn additional tokens just by holding the tokens in their own wallet or in a self-custody vault like behind the Dumper Shield. These staking rewards are paid out at regular intervals (determined by the Binance Smart Chain block time, which is approximately 3-5 seconds) simply for holding the tokens. 
The initial annual percentage yield (APY) for staking rewards is ~10%, but this rate can be changed by a vote of the VRS DAO (decentralized autonomous organization). It's important to note that any VRS tokens sent to the self-custody staking contract (which is 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000001 address) are considered burned and cannot be recovered for trading, even through voting, without the self-custody staking smart contract. This incentivizes users to hold their VRS in a secure and easily accessible location, such as their own wallet or a self-custody vault.[4]


Trading reward
As part of the go to market Multiverse strategy is to incentivize traders with dVoucher rewards that are subject to the their investment amount. The dVocuher will allow user at any time and at no cost, to cash out at the dVocuher and claim any token in the Qwantum finance labs ecosystem with the same 1:1 face value.

There are two type of rewards. one is for P2P trades and second is for P2C traders.
P2P trades
Halving reward


P2P (Peer-to-Peer) traders will receive a 250% bonus on their total trading in the first month, but the reward will be halved in the second month to 125%, and will continue to decrease every month over a period of six months, eventually reaching 7.81%.
	P2C traders
Reverse halving reward


P2C (Peer-to-Contract) traders will receive a 7.81% bonus on their total trading in the first month, but the reward will be doubled in the second month to 15.6%, and will continue to increase every month over a period of six months, eventually reaching 250%.

Concept 
The trading reward is designed to first attract P2P (peer-to-peer) traders, with the goal of exposing them to experience the P2C (peer-to-contract) model through RMM (reverse market making).


Supply 
The available supply of dVocuher for trading rewards across all Qwantum Finance Labs RMM exchanges is capped at $1 billion or a maximum of 6 months for each new project, whichever limit is reached first.
 
Keep it fair 
To ensure fairness and prevent abuse by bad actors, dVoucher rewards can only be claimed by buyer wallets that have completed purchases of landss on the Multiverse exchange and hold KYC soulbound tokens from reputable issuers. This way, many users can access rewards, rather than just a few who use fake wallets. Traders who do not currently have a KYC soulbound token on their wallet can still participate by utilizing the Qwantum Finance Labs Reverse KYC process. This means that traders can participate in trading right away and complete their KYC verification at a later date, while their dVoucher rewards are kept on a Reverse KYC special smart contract until their wallet holds a KYC soulbound token. 
The total reward for a unique user from Multiverse is capped at $10,000 dVoucher value.

EVM 
The Multiverse project is designed to scale to all Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-based blockchains, including layer 2 scaling solutions. Additionally, if there is enough demand for it, the Multiverse team is open to adapting the code to fit non-EVM based chains such as the Lightning Network for Bitcoin, Cardano, and others.
 
Scarcity
Multiverse is designed to have a limited supply of tokens for trading. tokens from pre-sell, public sale, IBO, and  PDO will be locked for a minimum of 90 days and then will be protected behind the Dumper shield, meaning they will not be able to be frelly traded in the market during that time. This helps to create scarcity of the tokens, which can drive up their value..[5]


DAO
Unlike other projects that rely on centralized voting, the Multiverse operates 100% on the blockchain through DAO voting by its VRS token holders. This ensures that all implementation decisions are made in real time directly by the community and not just the project team.

RMM sister companies 
Multiverse has sister companies that utilize comparable RMM technology but focus on various industries such as the NFT, Music, Movies, Gaming, and VTuber. These sister companies collaborate in terms of traffic and enable VRS token holders to expand their access to liquidity through the Liquidity Router.
Liquidity Router
A Liquidity Router is a smart contract that enables token holders to transfer their tokens from one project within the Qwantum finance Labs ecosystem to another, at a 1:1 $ face value. This allows holders of tokens with limited liquidity on their current project to move them to more liquid projects, reducing the risk of harm to both the project and the holder in the event of an exit. Additionally, as many startups have a high failure rate, it's likely that not all Qwantum finance Labs projects will be successful. The Liquidity Route allows holders to recover some of their loss by moving their tokens to a more successful project. The router works by "burning" the original token and minting a new one with the same value, which is placed under a Dumper Shield as a secondary priority to the "original" tokens on the new project. This means that tokens that were bought directly on a project have higher priority engage with liquidity, while transferred tokens have lower priority.


Licensing
Qwantum Finance Labs' main go-to-market strategy is a B2B2C model, in which potential partners can apply for white label licensing to benefit from fees and their own branding. This approach is meant to prevent competition from copycat projects and allow the company to focus on end users without having to spend a large amount of time and budget on them.
